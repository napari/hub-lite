Annotrack is a napari plugin for annotating errors in object trajectories. The plugin will help you take a sample of track segments along with a small section of corresponding image and segmentation. Annotrack allows you to annotate three types of errors: (1) ID swap errors (track jumps between objects), (2) false starts (track starts on a pre-existing object) and false terminations (track ends but object still exists). By looking at the combined rates of false starts and false terminations you can assess track discontinutation errors. 

**Please note:** Images and segmentations must be in zarr format. Tracks should be in parquet format.  

## Installation 

There are three main ways to install annotrack:

### Install Using pip
*Please note that this is planned/under development*

Type the following into your terminal (MacOS or Ubuntu) or annaconda prompt (windows):

```bash
pip install annotrack
```

### Install
*Please note that this is planned/under development*

Type the following into your terminal (MacOS or Ubuntu) or annaconda prompt (windows):

```bash
install napari
napari
```

Once napari has opened (this may take a second the first time you open it), go to the pannel at the top of the screen and select the 'plugins' dropdown. Then select install/uninstall plugins. A new window will open showing available plugins. Either scroll down to or search 'annotrack' and click 'install'. 

### Install from Source Code
*please use this for now*

Type the following into your terminal (MacOS or Ubuntu) or annaconda prompt (windows):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AbigailMcGovern/annotrack.git
cd annotrack
pip install .
```

## Opening Annotrack
Once annotrack is properly installed you will be able to open annotrack by opening napari. You can open napari through the command line (terminal (MacOS or Ubuntu) or annaconda prompt (windows)) as follows:

```bash
napari
```

You can find the annotrack widgets by selecting the dropdown 'plugins' at the pannel at the top of the screen and hovering over 'annotrack'.  

## Sample from CSV

To sample your tracks you will need to supply the file paths for the images, segmentations, and tracks. You supply this in a csv that is structured as shown below:

 ![csv_structure widget](https://github.com/AbigailMcGovern/annotrack/blob/main/media/csv_structure.png)

In this csv, you may also specify how many samples are to be taken from each file. If this is not provided, annotrack will use the value you supply to the `sample_from_csv` widget. The csv must contain a column that specifies a category to which each sample belongs (e.g., species, experimental condition, drug, etc.).  If this isnt important for your samples, just add a dummy category (e.g., sample_type : [A, A, A, A]). 

To access the widget and sample track segments, go to the top of the screen, go to **plugins > annotrack > sample_from_csv**. When the widget is displayed, select the csv file, select a directory into which to save results, and proivide a name for the summary data file (i.e., where your annotations will be written). 

 ![sample_from_csv widget](https://github.com/AbigailMcGovern/annotrack/blob/main/media/sample_from_csv.png)

### Widget parameters
- **path to csv**: 
        The path storing the info from which to generate the samples. 
        The CSV should have the columns: image_path, labels_path, tracks_path, <category_col>, 
        You can also add an optional n_samples column if you would like to 
        specify how many samples to take from each individual file. Otherwise, 
        the default ""n_samples"" you've supplied will be used.
- **output dir**: 
        Where will the output be saved?
- **output name**: 
        What will output summary files/directories be called?
- **n samples**: 
        How many samples to be obtained from each file. Will be overwritten
        if there is a valid integer number in the n_samples colum of the csv.
- **tzyx cols**: 
        What are the names of the columns denoting time (in frames) and coordinate
        positions (in pixels) in the file containing tracks? The order should be:
        t, z, y, x. 
- **id col**: 
        What is the name of the column denoting the specific ID for each tracked
        object?
- **scale**: 
        size of pixels (e.g., in um) for the z, y, and x coordinates (in that
        order)
- **frames**: 
        Approximate maximum number of frames of track segment. 
        Max frames = frames (if even) or frames - 1 (if odd)
- **box size**: 
        Approximate size of bounding box (in pixels). 
- **min track len**: 
        You can set a minimum track len to include in the search. 
        This can help to eliminate less useful data. This should be at least 1 to only include tracked objects. Set higher only if you are specifically interested in longer lived tracks. 
- **image channel**: 
        This denotes the index of the channel from which to get 
        image data (0: channel 1, 1: channel 2, 2: channel 3, 3: channel 4)

### Annotate Now?

In the case that we are annotating multiple conditions to compare, we want to show them in the one session in randomised order with the annotator blinded to where the sample has originated from. We want to be able to annotated unannotated data from the sample without having the burden of having to do this all at once. The annotations are therefore saved into the saved sample. A selected number of samples saved from the various tracking experiments can be annotated using the following code. If you re-execute this code, you will only be shown not yet annotated data, unless you request otherwise.

Keys to navagate and annotate samples
- '2' - move to next sample
- '1' - move to previous sample
- 'y' - annotate as correct (will move to the next sample automatically)
- 'n' - annotate as containing an error (will move to the next sample automatically)
- 'i' - annotate the frame following a ID swap error
- 't' - annotate the fame following an incorrect termination
- 'Shift-t' - annotate the frame containing a false start error
- 's' - annotate an error ('i', 't', or 'Shift-t') as being associated with a segmentation error (merge or split of objects)

When an error is associated the specific frame ('i', 't', 'Shift-t', or 's'), the frame number (within the original image) will be added to a list of errors for the sample within the sample's (.smpl) info data frame. E.g., you may have a list of ID swaps for your sampled track segment (`[108, 111, 112]`) and a corresponding list of segmentation error associations (`[108, 112]`). 

## Annotate Existing Sample
If you have already saved a sample and want to annotate it, you can load the sample data using the `annotate_existing_sample` widget. This might be useful if you want to have several annotators annotate the same sample. To access this widget, open napari

## Introduction

This repository contains a dedicated ARCOS.px plugin for the [napari](https://napari.org/stable/) image viewer. It tracks spatio-temporal correlations in images as described in a publication of Grädel et al. _Tracking Coordinated Cellular Dynamics in Time-Lapse Microscopy with ARCOS.px_ ([link](https://doi.org/10.1101/2025.03.14.643386)).

  <img alt=""CDL logo"" src=""misc/cellular-dynamics-lab-logo2.png"" width=""45%""> 
</p>

ARCOS.px is a computational method to identify and track clusters of correlated cell signaling in time-lapse microscopy images. 
It is the latest addition to the [ARCOS ecosystem](https://arcos.gitbook.io/home) developed in the [Cellular Dynamics Lab](https://www.pertzlab.net) at the University of Bern.

## Measuring single-cell susceptibility to antibiotics within monoclonal fluorescent bacteria.

We are imaging the entire chip using 20x 0.7NA objective lens using automatic stitching in NIS.
Bright-field image 2D and TRITC-3D acquired. The 3D stack is converted to 2D using maximum projection in NIS or Fiji. Both channels are then merged together and saved as a tif stack. After that this package can be applied to detect the individual droplets and count the fluorescent cells.

As the chips are bonded to the coverslip manually, they contain a randon tilt and shift, so detecting individual droplets proved to be unreliable. The current approach consisnts of preparing a well-lebelled template bright-field image and a labelled mask and matching the experimental brightfield image to the template.

## Installation
```bash
pip install anchor-droplet-chip
```
## Usage

1. Notebook: `jupyter lab example.ipynb`
2. Napari plugin: see the menu `Plugins / andhor-droplet-chips / ...
3. Command line:

    `python -m adc.align --help`

    `python -m adc.count --help`

### Dowloading the raw data
Head to release page https://github.com/BaroudLab/anchor-droplet-chip/releases/tag/v0.0.1 and download files one by one.

Or

Execute the notebook example.ipynb - the data will be fetched automatically.

### Aligning the chips with the template and the mask

Day 1:
```bash
python -m adc.align day1/00ng_BF_TRITC_bin2.tif template_bin16_bf.tif labels_bin2.tif
```
This command will create the stack day1/00ng_BF_TRITC_bin2-aligned.tif, which can be viewed in Fiji.
![Screenshot of 00ng_BF_TRITC_bin2-aligned.tif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11408456/176169270-3d494fc3-a771-4bf0-859e-c9cc853ce2d9.png)

Day 2:
```bash
python -m adc.align day2/00ng_BF_TRITC_bin2_24h.tif template_bin16_bf.tif labels_bin2.tif
```

### Counting the cells day 1 and day2
```
python -m adc.count day1/00ng_BF_TRITC_bin2-aligned.tif day1/counts.csv
python -m adc.count day2/00ng_BF_TRITC_bin2_24h-aligned.tif day2/counts.csv
```

### Combining the tables from 2 days
```
python adc.merge day1/counts.csv day2/counts.csv table.csv
```

### Plotting and fitting the probabilities


## Sample data

### Batch processing:

First you'll need to clone the repo locally and install it to have the scripts at hand.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BaroudLab/anchor-droplet-chip.git

cd anchor-droplet-chip

pip install .
```
Make a data folder
```bash
mkdir data

```
Download the dataset from Zenodo https://zenodo.org/record/6940212
```bash
zenodo_get 6940212 -o data
```
Proceed with Snakemake pipeline to get tha table and plots. Be careful with the number of threads `-c` as a single thread can consume over 8 GBs of RAM.
```bash
snakemake -c4 -d data table.csv
```

# Napari plugin functionaluties

## nd2 reader

Open large nd2 file by drag-n-drop and select anchor-droplet-chip as a reader.
The reader plugin will aotimatically detect the subchannels and split them in different layers.
The reader will also extract the pixel size from metadata and save it as Layer.metadata[""pixel_size_um""]
The data itself is opened ad dask array using nd2 python library.

## Substack

Some datasets are so big, it's hard to even to open them, let alone doing processing in them.
`anchor-droplet-chip / Make a sub stack ` addresses this problem.
Upon opening the plugin you'll see all  dimensions of you dataset, and the axes will become named accordingly.
Simply choose the subset of data you need, and click ""Crop it!"". This will create a new layer with the subset of data.
Note that no new files are created in the process and in the background nd2 library lazy loading chunks of data from the original nd2 file.

## Populate ROIs along the line
Draw a line in the new shapes layer and call the widget. It will populate square ROIs along the line. Adjust the number of columns and rows. This way you can manually map the 2D wells on your chip.

## Crop ROIs
Use this widget to crop the mapped previously ROIs. The extracted crops can be saved as tifs.

## Split along axis

Allows to split any dataset along a selected axis and save the pieces as separate tifs (imagej format, so only TZCYX axes supported)
* Select the axis name
* Click Split it! and check the table with the names, shapes and paths.
* To change the prefix, set the folder by clicking at ""Choose folder""
* Once the table looks right, click ""Save tifs"" and wait. The colunm ""saved"" will be updated along the way.

This repository contains the beta version of AlveolEye, created by the [Sucre lab](https://www.sucrelab.org/).  
The code is authored by Samuel Hirsh, Joseph Hirsh, Nick Negretti, and Shawyon Shirazi.

AlveolEye is a Napari plugin that uses computer vision and classical image processing  
to calculate mean linear intercept (MLI) and airspace volume density (ASVD) of histologic images.

The goal of this tool is to aid researchers, not provide a complete automated annotation solution.

We welcome GitHub issues and feedback!

## Manual Annotation Guide

### Label Reference

| Structure          | Label Number |
|--------------------|--------------|
| Blocker            | 1            |
| Airway Epithelium  | 2            |
| Vessel Endothelium | 3            |
| Airway Lumen       | 4            |
| Vessel Lumen       | 5            |
| Parenchyma         | 6            |
| Alveoli            | 7            |

### Annotation Tips

- **Eyedropper tool**: Click the eyedropper tool, then click a pixel in the image to set your active label (for drawing and editing) to that pixel's label.  
- **Layer selection**: Ensure you're working on the correct layer before annotating.  
- **Visibility control**: Hide unnecessary layers using the eye icon on the layer boxes (to the left of the image viewer) for clearer viewing.
- **Blocking**: Encircle airways and vessels in the blocking label, and everything within that closed shape will be discounted from assessments calculation.

This GUI plugin allows you to quickly find the affine matrix mapping
one image to another using manual correspondence points annotation.

More simply, this plugin allows you to select corresponding points
on an image, and a second image you wish to transform. It computes 
the requisite transformation matrix using Affine Transform, Euclidean Transform, 
or Similarity Transform, and performs this transformation on the
moving image, aligning it to the reference image.

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/17995243/120086403-f1d0b300-c121-11eb-8000-a44a2ac54339.mp4


# Who is This For?

This is a simple plugin which can be used on any 2D images, provided
they can be loaded as layers into napari. The images need not be the same
file format and this plugin also works with labels layers.

No prior understanding of the transformation methods is required, as
they perform in the background based on the reference points selected.

# How to Guide

You will need a combination of two or more 2D image and/or labels layers 
loaded into napari. Once you have installed affinder, you can find it in
the dock widgets menu.

![Affinder widget in the Plugins->Add Dock Widget menu](https://i.imgur.com/w7MCXQy.png)

The first two dropdown boxes will be populated with the layers currently
loaded into napari. Select a layer to use as reference, and another to
transform.

![Dropdowns allow you to select the reference and moving layers](https://i.imgur.com/Tdbm1sX.png)

Next, you can select the transformation model to use (affine is selected by default
and is the least rigid transformation of those available). See [below](#transformation-models) for a
description of the different models.

Finally, you can optionally select a path to a text file for saving out the
resulting transformation matrix.

When you click Start, affinder will add two points layers to napari. 
The plugin will also bring your reference image in focus, and its associated points
layer. You can then start adding reference points by clicking on your image.

![Adding reference points to layer](https://i.imgur.com/WPzNtyy.png)

Once three points are added, affinder will switch focus to the moving image,
and you should then proceed to select the corresponding three points.

![Adding corresponding points to newly focused layer](https://i.imgur.com/JVZCvmp.png)

affinder will immediately transform the moving image to align the points you've
selected when you add your third corresponding point to your moving image.

![The moving image is transformed once three points are added](https://i.imgur.com/NTne9fj.png)

From there, you can continue iteratively adding points until you 
are happy with the alignment. Affinder will switch focus between
reference and moving image with each point.

Click Finish to exit affinder.

## Transformation Models

There are three transformation models available for use with affinder.
They are listed here in order of increasing rigidity in the types of
transforms they will allow. The eponymous Affine Transform is the 
least rigid and is the default choice.

- [**Affine Transform**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affine_transformation): 
the least rigid transformation, it preserves
lines and parallelism, but not necessarily distance and angles. Translation,
scaling, similarity, reflection, rotation and shearing are all valid
affine transformations.

- [**Similarity Transform**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Similarity_(geometry)): 
this is a ""shape preserving"" transformation, producing objects which are 
geometrically similar. Translation, rotation, reflection and uniform scaling are 
valid similarity transforms. Shearing is not.

- [**Euclidean Transform**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigid_transformation):
Also known as a rigid transformation, this transform preserves the Euclidean
distance between each pair of points on the image. This includes rotation,
translation and reflection but not scaling or shearing.

The acquifer-napari plugin allows loading IM04 dataset directory, as multi-dimensional images in napari.  
Sliders for well, channel, time and Z are automatically rendered when there are more than 1 coordinates along the dimension.  
The plugin uses Dask-Image for efficient data-loading ""on request"" similar to the VirtualStack in ImageJ.  

## Installation
Via the napari plugin manager : acquifer-napari.
Or with pip : `pip install acquifer-napari`.

Use `pip install -e .` to install in developement mode, so any change in the source code is directly reflected.  
Use `npe2 list` to check that the plugin is correctly installed and visible by napari.  
For instance here, the package defines 1 command, which is a reader.  
One could have more commands, which would be implement other types.   
This should output something like following 
┌──────────────────────────────┬─────────┬──────┬───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Name                         │ Version │ Npe2 │ Contributions                                             │
├──────────────────────────────┼─────────┼──────┼───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ acquifer-napari              │ 0.0.1   │ ✅   │ commands (1), readers (1)

The plugin should be installed in an environment with napari installed.  
Napari can be started with the `napari`command in a command prompt with a system wide python installation.  
Once installed, napari can be opened in a IPython interactive session with

```python
>> import napari
>> napari.Viewer()
```

## Configurations
The file `napari.yaml` in `acquifer_napari_plugin` defines what functions of the python package are visible to napari.  
The top level `name` field must be the same than the python package name defined in `setup.cfg`.
It first define a set of commands, which have a custom `id`, and a `python_name`, which is the actual location of the function in the python package (or module).  
Then the napari.yaml has optional subsections `readers`, `writers`, `widget`, to reference some of the commands previously defined, to notify napari that they implemente those standard functions.  
For instance I first define a command myReader pointing to myPackage.myReader, and I reference that command using the id it in the section readers

A napari plugin to detect and visualize collective signaling events

----------------------------------
- Package specific Documentation: <https://pertzlab.github.io/arcos-gui>
- ARCOS documentation: <https://arcos.gitbook.io>

**A**utomated **R**ecognition of **C**ollective **S**ignalling (ARCOS) is an algorithm to identify collective spatial events in time series data.
It is available as an [R (ARCOS)](https://github.com/pertzlab/ARCOS) and [python (arcos4py)](https://github.com/pertzlab/arcos4py) package.
ARCOS can identify and visualize collective protein activation in 2- and 3D cell cultures over time.

This plugin integrates ARCOS into napari. Users can import tracked time-series data in CSV format or load data from napari-layer properties (such as the ones generated with [napari-skimage-regionprops](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-skimage-regionprops). The plugin
provides GUI elements to process this data with ARCOS. Layers containing the detected collective events are subsequently added to the viewer.

Following analysis, the user can export the output as a CSV file with the detected collective events or as a sequence of images to generate a movie.

Projected Barzilai-Borwein Image Deconvolution with Infeasible Iterates (BBii-Decon)


The projected Barzilai-Borwein method of image deconvolution utilizing infeasible iterates (BBii-Decon), utilizes Barzilai-Borwein (BB) or projected BB (PBB) method and enforces a nonnegativity constraint, but allows for infeasible iterates between projections. This algorithm (BBii) results in faster convergence than the basic PBB method, while achieving better quality images, with reduced background than the unconstrained BB method (1). 

The code represented is based on the original BBii algorithm written in MatLab by Kathleen Fraser and Dirk Arnold, which was ported to python 3.8 by Graham Dellaire, Dirk Arnold and Kathleen Fraser for non-commercial use.

The first implementation shown here is for 2D deconvolution using a known 2D PSF of 256 X 256 pixels, and images of at least 256 pixels in one dimension. One file implements just the deconvolution of a blurred image, while the second file contains a modification of the BBii-Decon algorithm that has a built in heuristic for measuring image reconstruction error relative to a ground truth image. For general 2D deconvolution, either a theoretical 2D PSF (if you know the optical properties of your system) or the central in focus image of a fluorescent bead taken with the same imaging setup (lens, magnification, camera) can produce a suitable PSF.

### GPU-acceleration

For most 2D deconvolution, optimal results are obtained with 10 iterations of the algorithm. However, if processing takes too long, acceleration using graphics processing units (GPUs) may make sense, especially for processing larger images with >10 iterations or 3D images. (Note: At this time BBii-Decon is optimized for 2D deconvolution, with a 3D implementation planned in future). 

This plugin supports accelerated processing using the [cupy](https://cupy.dev) library. To make use of it, please follow 
[the instructions](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html#installing-cupy-from-conda-forge) to install cupy. 
Installation may look like this:
```
conda create --name cupy_p38 python=3.8
conda activate cupy_p38
conda install -c conda-forge cupy cudatoolkit=10.2
```

If cupy installation worked out, you will find another checkbox in the user interface. By activating it, processing 
should become faster by factor 5-10, depending on processed image data and use GPU hardware.

![img.png](https://github.com/gdellaire/BBii-Decon/raw/main/demo/use_GPU_checkbox.png)

## Usage - napari

You can use the BBii deconvolution from within napari by clicking the menu `Plugins > bbii-decon > bbii deconvolution`. 
In the dialog, select the PSF, the image to process (a) and click on `Run`. After a moment, the deconvolved image (b) 
will show up.

![img.png](https://github.com/gdellaire/BBii-Decon/raw/main/demo/screenshot_napari.png)

## Usage from python

You can also call the function from python. There is a full working example in [this notebook](demo/BBii_Decon_2D_2021.ipynb).

```
from bbii_decon import bbii

bbii(PSF, image, number_of_iterations = 15, tau = 1.0e-08, rho = 0.98)
```

## Installation for developers

Clone the github repository:

```
conda install git

git clone https://github.com/gdellaire/BBii-Decon.git

cd BBii-Decon

pip install -e .
```

## Deployment to pypi

For deploying the plugin to the python package index (pypi), one needs a [pypi user account](https://pypi.org/account/register/) 
first. For deploying the plugin to pypi, one needs to install some tools:

```
python -m pip install --user --upgrade setuptools wheel
python -m pip install --user --upgrade twine
```

The following command allows us to package the souce code as a python wheel. Make sure that the 'dist' and 'build' folders are deleted before doing this:

```
python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
```

This command ships the just generated to pypi:

```
python -m twine upload --repository pypi dist/*
```

----------------------------------

A [napari] plugin for stitching tiled 3D acquisitions from a [mesoSPIM] light-sheet microscope.
The plugin utilises [BigStitcher] to align the tiles and napari to visualise the stitched data.

## Installation

We strongly recommend to use a virtual environment manager (like `conda`). The installation instructions below
will not specify the Qt backend for napari, and you will therefore need to install that separately. Please see the
[`napari` installation instructions](https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/fundamentals/installation.html) for further advice on this.

To install latest development version:

    pip install git+https://github.com/brainglobe/brainglobe-stitch.git

This plugin requires Fiji to be installed on your system. You can download Fiji [here](https://imagej.net/Fiji/Downloads).

The BigStitcher plugin must be installed in Fiji. Please follow the instructions [here](https://imagej.net/plugins/bigstitcher/#download).

Registration to a BrainGlobe atlas using Elastix

----------------------------------

> [!WARNING]
> This tool is in very early development. The interface may change and some features are not yet available.

A [napari] plugin for registering images to a BrainGlobe atlas.

![brainglobe-registration](./imgs/brainglobe_registration_main.png)

## Usage

1. Open `napari`.
2. [Install the plugin](#Installation).
3. Open the widget by selecting `Plugins > BrainGlobe Registration` in the napari menu bar near the
top left of the window.
![brainglobe-registration-plugin](./imgs/brainglobe_registration_plugin_window.png)
The `BrainGlobe Registration` plugin will appear on the right hand side of the napari window.
4. Open the image you want to register in napari (a sample 2D image can be found by selecting `File > Open Sample > Sample Brain Slice`).
5. Select the atlas you want to register to from the dropdown menu.
![brainglobe-registration-atlas-selection](./imgs/brainglobe_registration_atlas_selection.png)
The atlas will appear in the napari viewer. Select the approximate `Z` slice of the atlas that you want to register to,
using the slider at the bottom of the napari viewer.
![brainglobe-registration-atlas-selection](./imgs/brainglobe_registration_atlas_selection_2.png)
6. Adjust the sample image to roughly match the atlas image.
You can do this by adjusting X and Y translation as well as rotating around the centre of the image.
You can overlay the two images by toggling `Grid` mode in the napari viewer (Ctrl+G).
You can then adjust the color map and opacity of the atlas image to make manual alignment easier.
![brainglobe-registration-overlay](./imgs/brainglobe_registration_overlay.png)
The sample image can be reset to its original position and orientation by clicking `Reset Image` in the `BrainGlobe Registration` plugin window.
7. Select the transformations you want to use from the dropdown menu. Set the transformation type to empty to remove a step.
Select from one of the three provided default parameter sets (elastix, ARA, or IBL). Customise the parameters further in the
`Parameters` tab.
8. Click `Run` to register the image. The registered image will appear in the napari viewer.

## Installation

We strongly recommend to use a virtual environment manager (like `conda` or `venv`). The installation instructions below
will not specify the Qt backend for napari, and you will therefore need to install that separately. Please see the
[`napari` installation instructions](https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/fundamentals/installation.html) for further advice on this.

You can install `brainglobe-registration` via [pip]:

    pip install brainglobe-registration

Visualise cellfinder and brainreg results with napari


----------------------------------


## Installation
This package is likely already installed
(e.g. with cellfinder, brainreg or another napari plugin), but if you want to
install it again, either use the napari plugin install GUI or you can
install `brainglobe-napari-io` via [pip]:

    pip install brainglobe-napari-io

## Usage
* Open napari (however you normally do it, but typically just type `napari` into your terminal, or click on your desktop icon)

### brainreg
#### Sample space
Drag your [brainreg](https://github.com/brainglobe/brainreg) output directory (the one with the log file) onto the napari window.

Various images should then open, including:
* `Registered image` - the image used for registration, downsampled to atlas resolution
* `atlas_name` - e.g. `allen_mouse_25um` the atlas labels, warped to your sample brain
* `Boundaries` - the boundaries of the atlas regions

If you downsampled additional channels, these will also be loaded.

Most of these images will not be visible by default. Click the little eye icon to toggle visibility.

_N.B. If you use a high resolution atlas (such as `allen_mouse_10um`), then the files can take a little while to load._

![sample_space](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brainglobe/brainglobe-napari-io/master/resources/sample_space.gif)


#### Atlas space
`napari-brainreg` also comes with an additional plugin, for visualising your data
in atlas space.

This is typically only used in other software, but you can enable it yourself:
* Open napari
* Navigate to `Plugins` -> `Plugin Call Order`
* In the `Plugin Sorter` window, select `napari_get_reader` from the `select hook...` dropdown box
* Drag `brainreg_read_dir_atlas_space` (the atlas space viewer plugin) above `brainreg_read_dir` (the normal plugin) to ensure that the atlas space plugin is used preferentially.


### cellfinder
#### Load cellfinder XML file
* Load your raw data (drag and drop the data directories into napari, one at a time)
* Drag and drop your cellfinder XML file (e.g. `cell_classification.xml`) into napari.

#### Load cellfinder directory
* Load your raw data (drag and drop the data directories into napari, one at a time)
* Drag and drop your cellfinder output directory into napari.

The plugin will then load your detected cells (in yellow) and the rejected cell
candidates (in blue). If you carried out registration, then these results will be
overlaid (similarly to the loading brainreg data, but transformed to the
coordinate space of your raw data).

**`blik`** is a tool for visualising and interacting with cryo-ET and subtomogram averaging data. It leverages the fast, multi-dimensional [napari viewer](https://napari.org) and the scientific python stack.

**DISCLAIMER**: this package is in development phase. Expect bugs and crashes. Please, report them on the issue tracker and ask if anything is unclear!

## Installation

You can either install `blik` through the [napari plugin system](https://napari.org/plugins/index.html), through pip, or get both napari and blik directly with:

```bash
pip install ""blik[all]""
```

The `[all]` qualifier also installs `pyqt5` as the napari GUI backend, and a few additional napari plugins that you might find useful in your workflow:
- [napari-properties-plotter](https://github.com/brisvag/napari-properties-plotter)
- [napari-properties-viewer](https://github.com/kevinyamauchi/napari-properties-viewer)
- [napari-label-interpolator](https://github.com/brisvag/napari-label-interpolator)

### Nightly build

If you'd like the most up to date `blik` possible, you can install directly from the `main` branch on github. This also uses napari `main`, so expect some instability!

```
pip install ""git+https://github.com/brisvag/blik.git@main#egg=blik[all]""
pip install ""git+https://github.com/napari/napari.git@main#egg=napari[all]""
```

## Basic Usage

From the command line:
```bash
napari -w blik -- /path/to.star /path/to/mrc/files/*
```

The `-w blik` is important for proper initialization of all the layers. Always open the main widget open to ensure nothing goes wrong!

*`blik` is just `napari`*. Particles and images are exposed as simple napari layers, which can be analysed and manipulated with simple python, and most importantly other [napari plugins](https://napari-hub.org/).

## Widgets

The main widget has a few functions:

- `experiment`: quickly switch to a different experiment id (typically, everything related to an individual tomogram such as volume, particles and segmentations)
- `new`: generate a new `segmentation`, a new manually-picked set of `particles`, or a new `surface`, `sphere`, or `filament picking` for segmentation, particle generation or volume resampling.
- `add to exp`: add a layer to the currently selected `experiment` (just a shorthand for `layer.metadata['experiment_id'] = current_exp_id`)
- `slice_thickness`: changes the slicing thickness in all dimensions in napari. Images will be averaged over that thickness, and all particles in the slice will be displayed.

There are also widgets for picking surfaces, spheres and filaments:

- `surface`: process a previously picked `surface picking` layer to generate a surface mesh and distribute particles on it for subtomogram averaging, or resample a tomogram along the surface.
- `sphere`: process a previously picked `sphere picking` layer to generate a sphere mesh and distribute particles on it for subtomogram averaging.
- `filament`: process a previously picked `filament picking` layer to generate a filament and distribute particles on it for subtomogram averaging, or resample a tomogram along the filament.

## Overview

Brainways is an AI-powered tool designed for the automated analysis of brain-wide activity networks from fluorescence imaging in coronal slices. It streamlines the process of registration, cell quantification, and statistical comparison between experimental groups, all accessible through a user-friendly interface without requiring programming expertise. For advanced users, Brainways also offers a flexible Python backend for customization.

![Brainways User Interface Demo](assets/brainways-ui.gif)

## Key Features

Brainways simplifies complex analysis workflows into manageable steps:

1.  **Rigid Registration:** Aligns coronal slices to a 3D reference atlas.
2.  **Non-rigid Registration:** Refines alignment to account for individual variations and tissue distortions.
3.  **Cell Detection:** Automatically identifies cells using the [StarDist](https://github.com/stardist/stardist) algorithm.
4.  **Quantification:** Counts cells within defined brain regions.
5.  **Statistical Analysis:**
    *   Performs ANOVA contrast analysis between experimental conditions.
    *   Conducts Partial Least Squares (PLS) analysis.
    *   Generates network graphs visualizing brain-wide activity patterns.

## Getting Started

!!! note ""Windows GPU Support Pre-installation""
    If you plan to use Brainways with GPU acceleration on Windows, you must install GPU-compatible versions of PyTorch and TensorBoard *before* installing Brainways. Follow the instructions on the [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and [TensorBoard](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip) websites. Once these dependencies are met, proceed with the Brainways installation below.

Install and launch the Brainways user interface using pip:

```bash
pip install brainways
brainways ui
```

For a detailed walkthrough, please refer to our [Getting Started Guide](02_getting_started.md).

!!! tip ""Achieving Reliable Results""
    To ensure the best possible outcomes with Brainways, we highly recommend reviewing our [Best Practices Guide](04_best_practices.md).

## Architecture

Brainways is built as a monorepo containing two primary components:

*   `brainways`: The core library housing all backend functionalities, including registration algorithms, quantification logic, and statistical tools. It can be used programmatically via Python for custom workflows. The automatic registration model inference code resides within the `brainways.model` subpackage.
*   `brainways.ui`: A [napari](https://napari.org/stable/) plugin providing the graphical user interface for interactive analysis.

## Development Status

Brainways is under active development by Ben Kantor at the Bartal Lab, Tel Aviv University, Israel. Check out our [releases page](https://github.com/bkntr/brainways/releases) for the latest updates.

A Napari plugin for cell/nuclei counting from a region or interest using
cellpose models.

----------------------------------

## Installation

Option 1: via [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) (or pip alternatives like
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/)):

Below is a minimally working example of setting up a new virtual environment and
installing the counter module with uv on Unix based systems.

```bash
uv venv # create virtual environment in .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

uv pip install ""napari[all]"" cellpose-counter
```

Option 2: via Docker/Podman. The provide [Dockerfile](./Dockerfile) can be used
to install Napari and the counter plugin along with a preconfigured Xpra server
using the napari-xpra image. Below is an example of building the image and
running the application with GPU support.

```bash
podman build -t cellpose-counter .
podman run -it -d \
    -p 9876:9876 \
    -e XPRA_START=""python3 -m napari -w cellpose-counter"" \
    --device nvidia.com/gpu=all
```

Then, navigate to `http://localhost:9876` to view the application in a virtual
machine.

Note: There is a known issue installing the plugin directly from Napari. Please
see [this issue](https://github.com/szablowskilab/cellpose-counter/issues/12)
for more updates.

## GPU Acceleration

To enable GPU acceleration, you will need a CUDA capable GPU along with the
[CUDA toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) and [cudNN library](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn).

For instructions on installing cuda toolkit and cudNN, see:

1. [cuda toolkit installation for Linux](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cuda-installation-guide-linux/index.html#fedora)
1. [cudNN installation for Linux](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/latest/installation/linux.html)

Once these are installed, update the pytorch package by first uninstalling torch
(if already instsalled).

```bash
uv pip uninstall torch
```

Then install a torch version that is compatible with your CUDA version. For example,

```bash
uv pip install torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
```

After installation, you can verify in an interactive python console with:

```python3
import torch
torch.cuda.is_available()
```

## Usage

To open Napari with the cellpose counter loaded, run `napari -w cellpose-counter`.

A dock widget will be open on the right side of the Napari interface. There
you can view options for restoring images (using the cellpose denoise module),
and counting cells/nuclei in a region of interest (ROI).

A few important notes:

1. Images in TIFF or CZI file formats may be used.
1. Images must be grayscale or single channel. RGB images may be loaded, but
should be split. You can do this by right clicking on the image and select
`split rgb` or `split stack`.
1. ROIs can be drawn using the shape layer tools. Only a single ROI can be drawn
per shape layer (otherwise only the first draw ROI will be used).
1. ROIs should be square or rectangular. You can draw ROIs as polygons or other
shapes, but a bounding box will be made from these shapes anyway.
1. For long running processes such as image restoration or counting, it may seem
like Napari is not doing anything. Notifications are shown in the viewer to
display import information and a small activity indicator can be seen in the
bottom right hand corner. If this indicator is spinning, then work is being done
even if it doesn't look like it.
1. In case of a large number of uncounted nuclei, consider modifying the
segmentation parameters, or use the `Continue Counting` option to re-run the
segmentation on uncounted nuclei.

## Updating

1. via Napari plugin manager. Select cellpose-counter plugin and update button.

1. via pip (or uv, ..., etc.)

```bash
uv pip install cellpose-counter --upgrade
```

Utilities for the semi-automated generation of instance segmentation annotations to be used for neural network training. Utilities are built ontop of [UMAP](https://github.com/lmcinnes/umap), [HDBSCAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02282) and a finetuned encoder version of FAIR's [Segment Anything Model](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file) developed by Computational Cell Analytics for the project [micro-sam](https://github.com/computational-cell-analytics/micro-sam/tree/master/micro_sam/sam_annotator). In addition to providing utilies for annotation building, we train networks using FAIR's [detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2) to 
1. Demonstrate the efficacy of our utilities. 
2. Be used for microscopy annotation of supported cell lines 

Cell-line specific models currently include:
1. HeLa
2. U2OS

Models have demonstrated performance efficacy on:
1. HT1080 (HeLa model)
2. RPE1 (U2OS model)

We've also developed a napari application for the usage of these pre-trained networks.


# Installation 
We highly recommend installing cell-AAP in a clean conda environment. To do so you must have [miniconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/miniconda/#quick-command-line-install) or [anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/) installed.

If a conda distribution has been installed:

1. Create and activate a clean environment 

        conda create -n cell-aap-env python=3.11.0
        conda activate cell-app-env

2. Within this environment install pip

        conda install pip

3. Then install cell-AAP from PyPi

        pip install cell-AAP --upgrade

4. Finally detectron2 must be built from source, atop cell-AAP
    
        #For MacOS
        CC=clang CXX=clang++ ARCHFLAGS=""-arch arm64"" python -m pip install 'git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2.git'

        #For other operating systems 
        python -m pip install 'git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2.git'



# Napari Plugin Usage

1. To open napari simply type ""napari"" into the command line, ensure that you are working the correct environment
2. To instantiate the plugin navigate to the ""Plugins"" menu and select ""cell-AAP""
3. You should now see the Plugin, where you can select an image, display it, and run inference on it. 


# Configs Best Practices

If running inference on large volumes of data, i.e. timeseries data >= 300 MB in size, we recommend to proceed in the following manner. 

1. Assemble a small, < 100 MB, substack of your data using python or a program like [ImageJ](https://imagej.net/ij/download.html)
2. Use this substack to find the optimal parameters for your data, (Number of Cells, Network confidence threshold)
3. Run Inference over the volume using the discovered optimal parameters


# Interpreting Results 

Once inference is complete the following colors indicate class prediction
- Red: Non-mitotic
- Blue: Mitotic

For analysis purposes, masks in the semantic and instance segmentations have the following value mapping:
Semantic
- 1: Non-mitotic
- 100: Mitotic

Instance
- $2x$: Non-mitotic
- $2x-1$: Mitotic

# brainreg

brainreg is an update to [amap](https://github.com/SainsburyWellcomeCentre/amap_python) (which is itself a port
of the [original Java software](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms11879)) to include multiple registration backends, and to support the many atlases provided by [brainglobe-atlasapi](https://github.com/brainglobe/brainglobe-atlasapi).
It also comes with an optional [napari plugin](https://github.com/brainglobe/brainreg-napari) if you'd rather use brainreg with through graphical interface.

Documentation for both the command-line tool and graphical interface can be found [here](https://brainglobe.info/documentation/brainreg/index.html).

For segmentation of bulk structures in 3D space (e.g. injection sites, Neuropixels probes), please see [brainglobe-segmentation](https://github.com/brainglobe/brainglobe-segmentation).

## Details

The aim of brainreg is to register the template brain (e.g. from the [Allen Reference Atlas](https://mouse.brain-map.org/static/atlas)) to the sample image.
Once this is complete, any other image in the template space can be aligned with the sample (such as region annotations, for segmentation of the sample image).
The template to sample transformation can also be inverted, allowing sample images to be aligned in a common coordinate space.

To do this, the template and sample images are filtered, and then registered in a three step process (reorientation, affine registration, and freeform registration).
The resulting transform from template to standard space is then applied to the atlas.

Full details of the process are in the [original aMAP paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms11879).

![An illustrated overview of the registration process](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/13147259/143553945-a046e918-7614-4211-814c-fc840bb0159d.png)

## Installation

To install both the command line tool and the napari plugin, run

```bash
pip install brainreg[napari]
```

in your desired Python environment.
To only install the command line tool with no GUI (e.g. to run brainreg on an HPC cluster), just run:

```bash
pip install brainreg
```

### Installing on macOS

If you are using macOS, please run

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge niftyreg
```

in your environment before installing, to ensure all dependencies are installed.

## Command line usage

### Basic usage

```bash
brainreg /path/to/raw/data /path/to/output/directory -v 5 2 2 --orientation psl
```

Full command-line arguments are available with `brainreg -h`, but please
[get in touch](mailto:code@adamltyson.com?subject=brainreg) if you have any questions.

### Mandatory arguments

- Path to the directory of the images. This can also be a text file pointing to the files.
- Output directory for all intermediate and final results.
- You must also specify the voxel sizes with the `-v` flag, see [specifying voxel size](https://brainglobe.info/documentation/general/image-definition.html#voxel-sizes) for details.

### Atlas

By default, brainreg will use the 25um version of the [Allen Mouse Brain Atlas](https://mouse.brain-map.org/).
To use another atlas (e.g. for another species, or another resolution), you must use the `--atlas` flag, followed by the string describing the atlas, e.g.:

```bash
--atlas allen_mouse_50um
```

To find out which atlases are available, once brainreg is installed, please run `brainglobe list`.
The name of the resulting atlases is the string to pass with the `--atlas` flag.

### Input data orientation

If your data does not match the BrainGlobe default orientation (the origin voxel is the most anterior, superior, left-most voxel), then you must specify the orientation by using the `--orientation` flag.
What follows must be a string in the [brainglobe-space](https://github.com/brainglobe/brainglobe-space) ""initials"" form, to describe the origin voxel.

If the origin of your data (first, top left voxel) is the most anterior, superior, left part of the brain, then the orientation string would be ""asl"" (anterior, superior, left), and you would use:

```bash
--orientation asl
```

### Registration options

To change how the actual registration performs, see [registration parameters](https://brainglobe.info/documentation/brainreg/user-guide/parameters.html)

### Additional options

- `-a` or `--additional` Paths to N additional channels to downsample to the same coordinate space.
- `--sort-input-file` If set to true, the input text file will be sorted using natural sorting. This means that the file paths will be sorted as would be expected by a human and not purely alphabetically.
- `--brain_geometry` Can be one of `full` (default) for full brain registration, `hemisphere_l` for left hemisphere data-set and `hemisphere_r` for right hemisphere data-set.

### Misc options

- `--n-free-cpus` The number of CPU cores on the machine to leave unused by the program to spare resources.
- `--debug` Debug mode. Will increase verbosity of logging and save all intermediate files for diagnosis of software issues.
- `--save-original-orientation` Option to save the registered atlas with the same orientation as the input data.

## Visualising results

If you have installed the optional [napari](https://github.com/napari/napari) plugin, you can use napari to view your data.
The plugin automatically fetches the [brainglobe-napari-io](https://github.com/brainglobe/brainglobe-napari-io) which provides this functionality.
If you have installed only the command-line tool you can still manually install [brainglobe-napari-io](https://github.com/brainglobe/brainglobe-napari-io) and follow the steps below.

### Sample space

Open napari and drag your brainreg output directory (the one with the log file) onto the napari window.

Various images should then open, including:

- `Registered image` - the image used for registration, downsampled to atlas resolution
- `atlas_name` - e.g. `allen_mouse_25um` the atlas labels, warped to your sample brain
- `Boundaries` - the boundaries of the atlas regions

If you downsampled additional channels, these will also be loaded.
Most of these images will not be visible by default - click the little eye icon to toggle visibility.

**Note:** If you use a high resolution atlas (such as `allen_mouse_10um`), then the files can take a little while to load.

Visualisation and management of BrainGlobe atlases in napari.

----------------------------------

A napari plugin to visualise and manage BrainGlobe atlases. `brainrender-napari` aims to port the functionality of [`brainrender`](https://github.com/brainglobe/brainrender) to [`napari`](https://napari.org/stable/).
![add-region-brainrender-napari](https://github.com/brainglobe/brainrender-napari/assets/10500965/24fd3752-0ba7-4f47-aabf-5de22ff0f69b)

## Usage

Check out the [""Visualising an atlas in napari""](https://brainglobe.info/tutorials/visualise-atlas-napari.html) tutorial in the BrainGlobe documentation.

## Installation

We strongly recommend to use a virtual environment manager (like `conda` or `venv`). The installation instructions below will not specify the Qt backend for napari, and you will therefore need to install that separately. Please see [the `napari` installation instructions](https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/fundamentals/installation.html) for further advice on this.

You can install `brainrender-napari` via [pip]:

A plugin to segment cochlear ribbon synapses. 

More is in the works, but for now it includes tools to more quickly generate ground truth ribbon segmentation (Plugins > SynapSeg - Ground Truth Widget).

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/stable/plugins/index.html
-->

## Installation

You can install `cochlea-synapseg` (receommended: in a new conda environment with up-to-date napari) via [pip]:

    python -m pip install cochlea-synapseg

## Usage

After successfull installation, you can find the plugin next time you launch napari (Plugins > SynapSeg - Ground Truth Widget).

The ground truth widget is divided into multiple sections, for ""quick use"", be sure to check the settings denoted with asterisks:

### Image Tools

![image_tools](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/323984ad-2cd3-4816-8ee5-e8b3f5063bc0)

\***1. Image Layer Selection** - use the dropdown to select the name of your image layer (here, the layer that contains the ribbon stain)

(First load a 3D image using one of napari's native readers, or using the Cochlea-Synapseg .zarr reader (reads a .zarr with '3d/raw' and '3d/labeled').)

\***2. Refresh Image Layer Selection** - update the list of available image layers in #1

**3. Pixel size information** - (in microns), used for some point readers to successfully convert real units to pixel coordinates. Can be left as 1 if this functionality is not needed.

**4. Split channels** - splits multiple channels into separate image layers (useful for FIJI-saved .tif images)

### Points Tools & Points to Labels

![points_tools](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6b271d5c-51c1-4ca4-b3c0-683dddd69dc8)

**5. Points Layer Selection and Refresh** - use the dropdown to select an existing points layer, use the refresh button to update the list (or skip to #8 if not loading in existing points)

**6. Real -> Pixel Units** - if you've loaded some points were saved in real units, make sure the pixel size information above in #3 is correct, then click ""real -> pixel units""

**7. Channel Adjustment** - some points (like ImageJ/FIJI rois or CellCounter points), show up in the wrong z plane because their ""slice"" coordinates are a combination of both slice and channel info. If this happens, set the number of channels (in the original image, where the ROIs were created!), and then click ""chan -> z convert"". Z coordinates of the points layer will be divided by the number of channels specified. 

\***8. New Points Layer** - if starting annotation from scratch, click to create a new points layer. #5 should automatically select this new layer. 

\***9. Rotate to XY and \*10. Auto-adjust Z** - these convenient functions allow you to quickly annotate points in Napari's 3D view. Simply click ""Rotate to XY before adding new points. These points will now have the correct XY position but will have missing Z information. (Rotate out of XY to confirm.) Click ""Auto-adjust z"" and the z will automatically adjust to the brightest point. 

**11. Manually Edit Z** - useful for overlapping points, can be used to manually edit the z position of ONLY selected points. Use the +/- arrow keys for single z steps type in a number to move a larger amount. 

**12. Snap too Max** - will automatically adjust all points to their local max (search radius defined in pixels in Advanced Settings -> snap to max rad). Useful for adjusting quickly dropped points, but proceed with caution if you have close-together points. 

\***13. Points to Labels** - the key functionality of the module, creates a label layer by performing a local segmentation on all points.

**14. Advanced Settings** - adjust settings for the points to labels function to optimize local segmentation and watershed separation of points. 

### Labels Tools

![labels_tools](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ef20ff6-61e2-4337-a177-8f957a67fb39)

**15. Lables Layer Selection and Refresh** - use the dropdown to select an existing labels layer, use the refresh button to update the list

**16. Make Labels Editable** - zarrs and other file formats tend to load in as dask arrays, which don't allow editing. Checking this box will make the labels layer editable by converting to a numpy array (will load the layer into memory, so be careful if dealing with large images!). This will allow you to edit the labels layer with tools like the paintbrush and eraser. Automatically enables if merging or removing labels is requested (see #17 and #19)

\***17. Remove a Label** - use the labels layer eyedropper tool to identify the ID of an unwanted label, then type in the box and click ""Remove label""

**18. Max Label Display** - shows the current maximum label ID. If you're painting labels by hand and need a new label ID, increment above this number. Use the refresh button to the right to get an up-to-date number if you've made changes to your label layer.

\***19. Merge labels** - if you have an existing labels layer, and then create new labels (e.g. from the points to labels function), select the layer you'd like to merge into your existing labels layer (i.e. box 15 and 19a should be different from one another!), and then click ""merge labels"". This function will automatically ensure overlapping label IDs are not used. 

**20. Labels to Points** - if wanted, you can take all your existing labels and convert them to a points layer based on their centroids. This may be helpful for quickly generating better labels using the points tools above. 

### Save to Zarr

![save_zarr](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1d824f49-012f-4fac-8fa1-64d7d319cd34)

Functionality to save to .zarr format. Saves image as '3d/raw' and labels as '3d/labeled'. Used for later auto-segmentation of ribbons (not live in this plugin yet, but coming soon!). 

\***21. File Path** - the directory in which to save the zarr; use the folder icon to search for an existing directory

\***22. File Name** - the zarr name to save to; use the magnifying glass icon to select an existing .zarr

**23. From Source** - set the file path and name to where the image layer was loaded from. (Caution: if you loaded a zarr, this will result in the zarr being overwritten!)

\***24. Save 3D Only (recommended)** - saves the image and labels layers (selected in #1 and #15) in the specified .zarr, as 3d/raw and 3d/labeled, respectively. A reader is included with this plugin for this format as well. 

**25. Save 2D and 3D** - (not recommended) to be used in the future if 2D models are to be run on the data, saves both the 3D stacks as in 24, and then individual 2D slices for each z in 2d/raw/[z] and 2d/labeled/[z]

## Installation

### Conda environment

It is highly recommended to create a dedicated conda environment, by following these few steps:

1. Install an [Anaconda] distribution of Python. Note you might need to use an anaconda prompt if you did not add anaconda to the path.

2. Open an Anaconda prompt as admin to create a new environment using [conda]. We advice to use python 3.10 and conda 23.10.0, to get conda-libmamba-solver as default solver.

```bash
conda create --name cut_detector python=3.10 conda=23.10.0
conda activate cut_detector
```

### Package installation

Once in a dedicated environment, our package can be installed via [pip]:

```bash
pip install cut_detector
```

Alternatively, you can clone the github repo to access to playground scripts.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/15bonte/cut-detector.git
cd cut-detector
pip install -e .
```

### GPU

We highly recommend to use GPU to speed up segmentation. To use your NVIDIA GPU, the first step is to download the dedicated driver from [NVIDIA].

Next we need to remove the CPU version of torch:

```bash
pip uninstall torch
```

The GPU version of torch to be installed can be found [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). You may choose the CUDA version supported by your GPU, and install it with conda. This package has been developed with the version 11.6, installed with this command:

```bash
conda install pytorch==1.12.1 torchvision pytorch-cuda=11.6 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```

## Update

To update cut-detector to the latest version, open an Anaconda prompt and use the following commands:

```bash
conda activate cut_detector
pip install cut-detector --upgrade
```

## Definitions

Each detected cell division is labeled with one of the following categories:

- NORMAL: Division happening as expected, where (at least) 1 micro-tubule cut is detected.
- NO_MID_BODY_DETECTED: Along the cell division, no mid-body was detected on the MKLP1 channel. This category encompasses different cases: the detection may have failed, the mid-body may not express the fluorescence, or this may not actually be a division.
- MORE_THAN_TWO_DAUGHTER_TRACKS: Tripolar division. This category encompasses both actual tripolar divisions and wrong identifications of daughter cells (mainly caused by segmentation issues).
- NEAR_BORDER: Division close to the border of the image, hence ignored as it is likely to be difficult to detect micro-tubule cuts. A division is classified as NEAR_BORDER as soon as the distance between 1 detected mid-body and the border of the image is less than 20px.
- NO_CUT_DETECTED: Division whose mid-body was detected, but with all micro-tubule bridges classified as ""No cut"". Likely to be at the end of the video, cells dying before the end of division, or cells going out of frame.
- TOO_SHORT_CUT: First micro-tubule cut detected before or at 50 minutes. Ignored as this is very unlikely, so it is probably caused by a wrong division detection.

Division movies start at the maximum between:

- Mother cell start frame
- 10 frames before the end of metaphase

Division movies end at the minimum between:

- Last frame of any of the daughter cells
- Metaphase of any of the daughter cells

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome. Tests can be run with [tox], please ensure
the coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request.

Scripts required to improve any of Cut Detector tasks can be found in the folder [developers].

# Bayesian Tracker (btrack) 🔬💻

`btrack` is a Python library for multi object tracking, used to reconstruct trajectories in crowded fields.
Here, we use a probabilistic network of information to perform the trajectory linking.
This method uses spatial information as well as appearance information for track linking.

The tracking algorithm assembles reliable sections of track that do not contain splitting events (tracklets).
Each new tracklet initiates a probabilistic model, and utilises this to predict future states (and error in states) of each of the objects in the field of view.
We assign new observations to the growing tracklets (linking) by evaluating the posterior probability of each potential linkage from a Bayesian belief matrix for all possible linkages.

The tracklets are then assembled into tracks by using multiple hypothesis testing and integer programming to identify a globally optimal solution.
The likelihood of each hypothesis is calculated for some or all of the tracklets based on heuristics.
The global solution identifies a sequence of high-likelihood hypotheses that accounts for all observations.

We developed `btrack` for cell tracking in time-lapse microscopy data.

## Installation

`btrack` has been tested with ![Python](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/btrack)
on `x86_64` `macos>=11`, `ubuntu>=20.04` and `windows>=10.0.17763`.
Note that `btrack<=0.5.0` was built against earlier version of
[Eigen](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org) which used `C++=11`, as of `btrack==0.5.1`
it is now built against `C++=17`.

### Installing the latest stable version

```sh
pip install btrack
```

## Usage examples

Visit [btrack documentation](https://btrack.readthedocs.io) to learn how to use it and see other examples.

### Cell tracking in time-lapse imaging data

 We provide integration with Napari, including a plugin for graph visualization, [arboretum](https://btrack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/napari.html).

# cellfinder

cellfinder is software for automated 3D cell detection in very large 3D images (e.g., serial two-photon or lightsheet volumes of whole mouse brains).
There are three different ways to interact and use it, each with different user interfaces and objectives in mind.
For more details, head over to [the documentation website](https://brainglobe.info/documentation/cellfinder/index.html).

At a glance:

- There is a command-line interface called [brainmapper](https://brainglobe.info/documentation/brainglobe-workflows/brainmapper/index.html) that integrates [with `brainreg`](https://github.com/brainglobe/brainreg) for automated cell detection and classification. You can install it through [`brainglobe-workflows`](https://brainglobe.info/documentation/brainglobe-workflows/index.html).
- There is a [napari plugin](https://brainglobe.info/documentation/cellfinder/user-guide/napari-plugin/index.html) for interacting graphically with the cellfinder tool.
- There is a [Python API](https://brainglobe.info/documentation/cellfinder/user-guide/cellfinder-core.html) to allow users to integrate BrainGlobe tools into their custom workflows.

## Installation

You can find [the installation instructions](https://brainglobe.info/documentation/cellfinder/installation.html#installation) on the BrainGlobe website, which will go into more detail about the installation process if you want to minimise your installation to suit your needs.
However, we recommend that users install `cellfinder` either through installing BrainGlobe version 1, or (if you also want the command-line interface) installing `brainglobe-workflows`.

```bash
# If you want to install all BrainGlobe tools, including cellfinder, in a consistent manner with one command:
pip install brainglobe>=1.0.0
# If you want to install the brainmapper CLI tool as well:
pip install brainglobe-workflows>=1.0.0
```

If you only want the `cellfinder` package by itself, you can `pip install` it alone:

```bash
pip install cellfinder>=1.0.0
```

Be sure to specify a version greater than version `v1.0.0` - prior to this version the `cellfinder` package had a very different structure that is incompatible with BrainGlobe version 1 and the other tools in the BrainGlobe suite.
See [our blog posts](https://brainglobe.info/blog/) for more information on the release of BrainGlobe version 1.

![cellpose-napari_plugin](https://cellpose-napari.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/napari_main_demo_fast_small.gif?raw=true ""cellpose-napari"")

## Installation

Install an [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) distribution of Python -- Choose **Python 3** and your operating system. Note you might need to use an anaconda prompt if you did not add anaconda to the path.

Install `napari` with pip: `pip install napari[all]`. Then install `cellpose-napari` via [pip]:

    pip install cellpose-napari
    
 Or install the plugin inside napari in the plugin window.

If install fails in your base environment, create a new environment:
1. Download the [`environment.yml`](https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose-napari/blob/master/environment.yml?raw=true) file from the repository. You can do this by cloning the repository, or copy-pasting the text from the file into a text document on your local computer.
2. Open an anaconda prompt / command prompt with `conda` for **python 3** in the path
3. Change directories to where the `environment.yml` is and run `conda env create -f environment.yml`
4. To activate this new environment, run `conda activate cellpose_napari`
5. You should see `(cellpose_napari)` on the left side of the terminal line. 

If you have **issues** with cellpose installation, see the [cellpose docs](https://cellpose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) for more details, and then if the suggestions fail, open an issue.

### Upgrading software

You can upgrade the plugin with
~~~
pip install cellpose-napari --upgrade
~~~

and you can upgrade cellpose with
~~~
pip install cellpose --upgrade
~~~

### GPU version (CUDA) on Windows or Linux

If you plan on running many images, you may want to install a GPU version of *torch* (if it isn't already installed).

Before installing the GPU version, remove the CPU version:
~~~
pip uninstall torch
~~~

Follow the instructions [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) to determine what version to install. The Anaconda install is recommended along with CUDA version 10.2. For instance this command will install the 10.2 version on Linux and Windows (note the `torchvision` and `torchaudio` commands are removed because cellpose doesn't require them):

~~~
conda install pytorch cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch
~~~~

When upgrading GPU Cellpose in the future, you will want to ignore dependencies (to ensure that the pip version of torch does not install):
~~~
pip install --no-deps cellpose --upgrade
~~~

### Installation of github version

Follow steps from above to install the dependencies. In the github repository, run `pip install -e .` and the github version will be installed. If you want to go back to the pip version of cellpose-napari, then say `pip install cellpose-napari`.


## Running the software


Open napari with the cellpose-napari dock widget open
```
napari -w cellpose-napari
```

There is sample data in the File menu, or get started with your own images!

A simple to use image generator based on [OpenAIs DALL-E 2/3](https://openai.com/dall-e-2).
It comes as [napari](https://napari.org/) plugin and has a Python interface. 
You need an [OpenAI API KEY](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api/) to use it.

Using some of the functions on scientific images could be seen as scientific misconduct. Handle these functions with care.

![](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/darth-d/raw/main/docs/images/replace_screencast.gif)

## Usage

### From Python

You can generate images from text prompts in Python like this ([see this notebool](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/darth-d/blob/main/demo/demo_darth-d.ipynb)).

```
from darth_d import create
```

```
image = create(""an image of a cat"")

image
```

![](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/darth-d/raw/main/docs/images/jupyter_screenshot.png)

You can also vary images ([see this notebook](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/darth-d/blob/main/demo/demo_vary.ipynb)):
```
from darth_d import vary

output_image = vary(input_image)
```

![](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/darth-d/raw/main/docs/images/vary_screenshot.png)

Replacing regions in images is also possible. Note: Using this function on scientific images could be seen as scientific misconduct. Handle this function with care.

### In Napari

To generate images in Napari, click the `Tools > Generate > Image` menu. You can for example enter the prompt
""a professional comic with white background showing a cat having an idea. the idea is visualized using a light bulb.

## Implemented Models

  - *MitoNet*: A generalist mitochondrial instance segmentation model.

## Example Datasets

Volume EM datasets for benchmarking mitochondrial instance segmentation are available from
[EMPIAR-10982](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/empiar/EMPIAR-10982/).

## Installation

### New Users

If you've previously installed and used conda, it's recommended (but optional) to create a new virtual 
environment in order to avoid dependency conflicts. 

empanada-napari works with python=3.9 or lower

It's recommended to have installed napari through [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). Then to install this plugin:

```shell
pip install empanada-napari==1.2
```

Launch napari:

```shell
napari
```

Look for empanada-napari under the ""Plugins"" menu.


### Returning Users

If you installed napari into a virtual environment as suggested in the original release documentation, 
be sure to activate it and uninstall the old empanada-napari.

```shell
pip uninstall empanada-napari
```

Then install the newest version:

```shell
pip install empanada-napari==1.2
```

## GPU Support

**Note: Mac doesn't support NVIDIA GPUS. This section only applies to Windows and Linux systems.**

As for any deep learning models, having a GPU installed on your system will significantly
increase model throughput (although we ship CPU optimized versions of all models with the plugin).

This plugin relies on torch for running models. If a GPU was found on your system, then you will see that the
""Use GPU"" checkbox is checked by default in the ""2D Inference"" and ""3D Inference"" plugin widgets. Or if when running
inference you see a message that says ""Using CPU"" in the terminal that means a GPU is not being used.

Make sure that GPU drivers are correctly installed. In terminal or command prompt:

```shell
nvidia-smi
```

If this returns ""command not found"" then you need to [install the driver from NVIDIA](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx). Instead, if
if the driver is installed correctly, you may need to switch to the GPU enabled version of torch.

First, uninstall the current version of torch:

```shell
pip uninstall torch
```

Then [install torch >= 1.10 using conda for your system](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).
This command should work:

```shell
conda install pytorch cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
```

## Preprocessing
### Dual-view Stack Registration
Registration of four-channel image stacks, including two excitation wavelengths and two emission pathbands, acquired with a dual-view beam splitter. This setup detects different spectral pathbands using distinct sides of the camera matrix.

- `offset img` - input for a four-channel time-lapse image stack.
- `reference img` - an optional four-channel reference image (e.g., fluorescence beads image), used for offset estimation if `use reference img` is selected.
- `input crop` - number of pixels that will be deleted from each side of input stack frames to discard misalignment artifacts from the dual-view system.
- `output crop` - number of pixels that will be deleted from each side of output stack frames to discard registration artifacts.


### Multichannel Stack Preprocessing
- `stack order` -  represents the order of axes in the input data array: T (time), C (color), X, and Y (image dimensions). If the input image stack has four dimensions (time, channel, x-axis, y-axis), channels will be split into individual three-dimensional images (time, x-axis, y-axis), each labeled with the `_ch%index%` suffix.
- `median filter` - provides frame-by-frame image smoothing with a kernel of size specified in `median kernel`.
- `background subtraction` -  compensates for background fluorescence intensity. Background intensity is estimated frame by frame as the 0.5 percentile of frame intensity.
- If the `photobleaching correction` option is selected, the image will undergo correction using either an exponential (method `exp`) or bi-exponential (method `bi_exp`) fitting.
- Image stacks can be cropped according to start and stop indexes specified in `frames range` if `drop frames` is selected.

## Detection of Fluorescence Redistribution
A set of widgets designed for preprocessing multispectral image stacks and detecting redistributions in fluorescence intensity. These widgets specifically analyze differential ""red-green"" image series to identify changes in fluorescence intensity.

Inspired by [Dovgan et al., 2010](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20704590/) and [Osypenko et al., 2019](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969996119301974?via%3Dihub).

### Red-Green Series
Primary method for detecting fluorescence-labeled targets redistribution. This widget returns a series of differential images, each representing the intensity difference between the current frame and the previous one, output image labeled with the `_red-green` suffix.

Parameters:

- `left frames` - specifies the number of previous frames used for pixel-wise averaging.
- `space frames` - determines the number of frames between the last left frame and the first right frame.
- `right frames` - specifies the number of subsequent frames used for pixel-wise averaging.

`normalize by int`  function normalizes the differential images relative to the absolute intensity of the input image stack, which helps to reduce background noise amplitude.

If `save MIP` is selected, the maximal intensity projection (MIP) of the differential image stack will be saved with the `_red-green-MIP` suffix.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wisstock/domb-napari/master/images/rg_series.png)

### ΔF/F Series
_In progress._

## Masking
### Dots Pattern Masking
Creates labels for bright dot elements on an image, such as pre- and postsynaptic fluorescence markers (e.g., Bassoon/Synaptobrevin for presynapses, PSD-95/Homer for postsynapses, etc.). It returns a labels layer with the `_dots-labels` suffix.

The widget detects the location on the MIP (Maximum Intensity Projection) of the input time series image and applies simple round masks to each detected dot. Watershed segmentation is then used to prevent the merging of overlapping masks.

Parameters:

- `background level` - Background level for filtering out low-intensity elements. This is specified as a percentile of the MIP intensity.
- `detection level` - Minimum intensity of dots, specified as a percentile of the MIP's maximum intensity.
- `mask diameter` - Diameter in pixels for the round mask of each individual dot.
- `minimal distance` - Minimum distance in pixels between the centers of individual round masks.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wisstock/domb-napari/master/images/dots_masking.png)
__Hippocalcin (green) and PSD95 (magents) in dendritic branches__


### Up Masking
Generates labels for regions with high intensity based on raw or -red-green images. Returns a labels layer with the `_up-labels` suffix.

The widget provides two detection modes:

- Global masking with a fixed threshold for the entire image.
- In-ROIs masking with a loop over individual ROIs in the input `ROIs mask` with separate detections.

Parameters:

- `det frame index` - index of the frame from the input image used for label detection.
- `det th` - treshold value for detecting bright sites, where the intensity on the selected frame is normalized in the range of -1 to 0.
- `in ROIs det` - option for activating in-ROIs masking.
- `in ROIs det method` - method for in-ROIs masking; otsu provides simple Otsu thresholding, while the threshold method is identical to global detection on nomilized detection frame.
- `in_ROIs_det_th_corr` - caling factor for the det th threshold value for in-ROIs masking.
- `final opening fp` - footprint size in pixels for mask filtering using morphological opening (disabled if set to 0).
- `final dilation fp` - footprint size in pixels for mask morphological dilation (disabled if set to 0).
- `save total up mask` - if selected, a total up mask (containing all ROIs) will be created with the _up-mask suffix.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wisstock/domb-napari/master/images/up_labels.png)
__Gplobal up labels__

The In-ROIs masking option can be particularly useful for co-localization detection. By applying a broad reference mask to several target images, you can create more precise labels for ROIs in specified cell compartments. The following examples demonstrate the detection of mutual locations for static PSD-95 enriched sites (postsynaptic membranes) and HPCA translocation sites only in the vicinity of synapses, using `_dots-labels` for PSD95-mRFP images.

_Note: In the In-ROIs masking mode, labels of detected sites correspond to the matching labels from the input ROIs mask._

### Intensity Masking
Extension of __Up Masking__ widget. Detects regions with increasing (`masking mode` - `up`) or decreasing (`masking mode` - `down`) intensity in `-red-green` images. Returns a labels layer with either `_up-labels` or `_down-labels` suffix, depending on the mode.

__ECFP and EYFP Setup:__

- Microscope Olympus IX71
- Camera PCO Sensicam QE
- Cube Chroma 69008
- Dual-view system with Chroma 505DCXR beam splitter
- Donor excitation wavelength 435 nm
- Acceptor excitation wavelength 505 nm

__TagBFP and mBaoJin Setup:__

- Microscope Olympus IX71
- Camera PCO Sensicam QE
- Cube Chroma 69002
- Dual-view system with Chroma 505DCXR beam splitter
- Donor excitation wavelength 405 nm
- Acceptor excitation wavelength 495 nm

This method utilizes default values of `a` and `d` coefficients and the `G`-factor for TagBFP and mBaoJin pair. 

Parameters:

- `DD img` - donor emission channel image acquired with the donor excitation wavelength.
- `AD img` - acceptor emission channel image acquired with the donor excitation wavelength.
- `AA img` - acceptor emission channel image acquired with the acceptor excitation wavelength.
- `output type` - type of output image: sensitized emission (`Fc`), apparent FRET efficiency (`Eapp`), or FRET efficiency with photobleaching correction (`Ecorr`).

If the `save normalized` option is selected, an additional image will be saved. This image is normalized to the absolute intensity of the `AA img`, which results in reduced background noise amplitude.

_Note: normalized images are useful for visual control and mask building only; they are not representative for quantitative analysis._

## Exo/Endo-cytosis Monitoring with pH-Sensitive Tag
A set of widgets designed for the analysis of image series containing the pH-sensitive fluorescence protein Superecliptic pHluorin (SEP).

Insipred by [Fujii et al., 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28474392/) and [Sposini et al., 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-020-0371-z).


### SEP image preprocessing
Processes image series obtained through repetitive pH exchange methods (such as U-tube or ppH approaches). `pH 1st frame` option indicates the 1st frame pH. By default frames with odd indexes, including index 0, are interpreted as images acquired at pH 7.0, representing total fluorescence intensity (saved with the suffix `_total`). Even frames are interpreted as images obtained at acidic pH (5.5-6.0), representing intracellular fluorescence only (saved with the suffix `_intra`).

If `calc surface img` is selected, an additional total fluorescence image with subtracted intracellular intensity will be saved as the cell surface fluorescence fraction (suffix `_surface`). The input image should be a 3-dimensional single-channel time-lapse.

The `calc projections` option allows obtaining individual pH series projections (pixel-wise series MIP - pixel-wise series average) for the detection of individual exo/endocytosis events.

## Plotting and Data Frame Saving
### ROIs Profiles
This widget builds a plot with mean intensity profiles for each Region of Interest (ROI) in labels. It uses either absolute intensity (if `absolute intensity` is selected) or relative intensities (ΔF/F0).

- `time scale` - sets the number of seconds between frames for x-axis scaling.
- `values mod` - the mode of output profile calculation. Options are `ΔF/F0` (relative intensity changes), `ΔF` (absolute intensity changes), or `abs` (absolute intensity value)
- `ΔF win` - if selected `use_simple_baseline`, the baseline intensity for ΔF/F0 profiles is estimated as the mean intensity of the specified number of initial profile points. Othervise, this paramater specify half-size of the moving median baseline estimator (`noisy_median` from `pybaselines` package).
- `profiles crop` - if selected, only a specified range of intensity profile indexes will be plotted, corresponding to the start and stop indexes from `profiles range`.

Additionally, you can save ROI intensity profiles as .csv files using the `save data frame` option and specifying the `saving path`. The output data frames named %img_name%_lab_prof.csv will include the following columns:

- `id` - unique image ID, the name of the input `napari.Image` object.
- `roi` - ROI number, consecutively numbered starting from 1.
- `int` - ROI mean intensity, either raw or ΔF/F0, according to the selected intensity option.
- `dist` - average distance in px to the ROI from the frame, (if `save ROIs distances in data frame` option is selected).
- `index` - frame index.
- `time` - frame time point, adjusted according to the `time scale`.

_Note: the data frame will contain information for all ROIs; amplitude filtering and crop options pertain to plotting only._

:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
__ΔF/F0__|![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wisstock/domb-napari/master/images/rois_df.png)


### Multiple Images Stat Profiles
This widget builds a plot displaying the average intensity of all Regions of Interest (ROIs) specified in `lab`. It can handle up to three images (`img 0`, `img 1`, and `img 2`) as inputs, depending on the selected `profiles num`.

`time scale`, `values mod`, and `ΔF win` parameters are identical as described in the __ROIs profiles__ widget.

The `stat method` allows estimation of intensity and associated errors using the following methods:
- `se` - mean ± standard error of the mean.
- `iqr` - median ± interquartile range.
- `ci` - mean ± 95% confidence interval (t-distribution).

### Multiple Labels Stat Profiles
This widget builds a plot displaying the averaged intensity of all Regions of Interest (ROI) for one target `img`. It can handle up to three labels (`lab 0`, `lab 1`, and `lab 2`), depending on the selected `profiles num`.

`time scale`, `values mod`, and `ΔF win` parameters are identical as described in the __ROIs profiles__ widget.

The `stat method` allows estimation of intensity and associated errors using the following methods:
- `se` - mean +/- standard error of the mean.
- `iqr` - median +/- interquartile range.
- `ci` - mean +/- 95% confidence interval based on the t-distribution.

### Save Data Frame
This widget allows saving the data frame with the following columns:

- `id` - unique image ID, the name of the input `napari.Image` object.
- `lab_id` - unique label ID, the name of the input `napari.Labels` object.
- `roi` - ROI number, consecutively numbered starting from 1.
- `dist` - average distance in px to the ROI from the frame, (if `save ROIs distances in data frame` option is selected).
- `index` - frame index.
- `time` - frame time point, adjusted according to the `time scale`.
- `abs_int` - absolute intensity value.
- `dF_int` - absolute intensity changes (ΔF).
- `dF/F0_int` - relative intensity changes (ΔF/F0).

## Installation

You can install `devbio-napari` via conda/mamba. If you have never used conda before, please [read this guide first](https://biapol.github.io/blog/mara_lampert/getting_started_with_mambaforge_and_python/readme.html).  
Start by creating an environment using mamba.

```
mamba create --name devbio-napari-env napari=0.4.19 python=3.9 devbio-napari pyqt -c conda-forge -c pytorch
```

Afterwards, activate the environment like this:

```
mamba activate devbio-napari-env
```

Afterwards, run this command from the command line

```
naparia
```

This window should open. It shows the [Assistant](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-assistant) graphical user interface. 
Read more about how to use it in its [documentation](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-assistant).

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/devbio-napari/raw/master/docs/screenshot.png)

## Troubleshooting: Graphics cards drivers

In case error messages contains ""ImportError: DLL load failed while importing cl: The specified procedure could not be found"" [see also](https://github.com/clEsperanto/pyclesperanto_prototype/issues/55) or """"clGetPlatformIDs failed: PLATFORM_NOT_FOUND_KHR"", please install recent drivers for your graphics card and/or OpenCL device. Select the right driver source depending on your hardware from this list:

* [AMD drivers](https://www.amd.com/en/support)
* [NVidia drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/download/index.aspx)
* [Intel GPU drivers](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/download/726609/intel-arc-graphics-windows-dch-driver.html)
* [Intel CPU OpenCL drivers](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/articles/tool/opencl-drivers.html#latest_CPU_runtime)
* [Microsoft Windows OpenCL support](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/opencl-and-opengl-compatibility-pack/9nqpsl29bfff)

Sometimes, mac-users need to install this:

    conda install -c conda-forge ocl_icd_wrapper_apple

Sometimes, linux users need to install this:

    conda install -c conda-forge ocl-icd-system


In case installation didn't work in the first attempt, you may have to call this command line to reset the napari configuration:

```
napari --reset
```

## Troubleshooting: pytorch

In case pytorch-related plugins fail, install pytorch as explained on [its website](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). Consider replacing `conda` with `mamba` in given instructions.

For example if you have an NVidia GPU at hand, install pytorch like this:
```
mamba install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.7 -c pytorch -c nvidia
```
Or if not:
```
mamba install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cpuonly -c pytorch
```

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome. 
If you want to [suggest a new napari plugin](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/devbio-napari/pulls) to become part of this distribution, please make sure it interoperates nicely with the other plugins. 
For example, if the plugin you suggest provided cell segmentation algorithms, please check if the resulting segmented cells can be analysed using napari-skimage-regionprops.
Furthermore, please make sure the README of the plugin you are proposing comes with user documentation, e.g. a step-by-step guide with screenshots explaining what users can do with the plugin and how to use it. 
It is recommended to provide example data as well so that end-users can try out the plugin under conditions it was developed for.

# cylindra

`cylindra` is a GUI-integrated cryo-ET image analysis tool for cylindric periodic
structures such as microtubules.

### [&rarr; Documentation](https://hanjinliu.github.io/cylindra/)

## Installation

- Use `pip`

```shell
pip install cylindra -U
```

- From source

If you install from the source, you'll need Rust to compile a part of the code.

```shell
git clone git+https://github.com/hanjinliu/cylindra
cd cylindra
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

#### Launch GUI

- From shell

  ```shell
  cylindra
  ```

- From a Python interpreter

  ```python
  from cylindra import start

  # launch a napari viewer with a cylindra dock widget.
  ui = start()
  ```

#### Command line interface

`cylindra` is implemented with some basic command line interface (CLI).

```shell
cylindra --help
```

## Implemented Functions

- Automatic/manual fitting of splines to cylindrical structures in 3D.
- Analyze lattice structures (such as lattice spacing and skew angle) using Cylindric
  Fourier transformation.
- Automatic determination of polarity, protofilament number etc.
- Monomer mapping along splines for subtomogram averaging and alignment.
- Microtubule seam search with or without binding proteins.
- Subtomogram alignment with 2D constraint.
- Tomogram simulation of cylindric structures.
- Efficient manual picking along cylindrical structures.

## Prerequisite and Recommendations

- **Python &ge; 3.10**. This project follows [spec-0000](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0000/).
- **Sufficient memory size**. Most of the intense calculations are done out-of-core
  using `dask`, so that you can even run on 8-GB memory PC in many cases. However,
  larger memory size will make parallel processing more efficient. &ge;32 GB is
  recommended.
- **Images should be loaded from SSD**. Raw image stacks are loaded lazily in most of
  the processes. Loading from HDD will slow down many analyses as well. In the latest version, you can use ""Cache image on SSD"" option to directly analyze tomograms stored in HDD.

## Issues

If you encountered any bugs or have any requests, feel free to
[report an issue](https://github.com/hanjinliu/cylindra/issues/new).
(We'll appreciate if you find some methods are over-fitted to microtubules and do not
work well on other cylindric structures)

For better reproducibility, please copy your environments from `Others > cylindra info`
and the recorded macro from `Others > Macro > Show macro`.

# Welcome to EpiTools!

EpiTools is a Python package and associated [napari](https://napari.org/stable/) plugin to extract the membrane signal from epithelial tissues and analyze it with the aid of computer vision.

The development of EpiTools was inspired by the challenges in analyzing time-lapses of growing Drosophila imaginal discs.

The folded morphology, the very small apical cell surfaces and the long time series required a new automated cell recognition to accurately study growth dynamics.

## Installation

First, install [napari](https://napari.org/index.html#installation).

The recommended way to install `EpiTools` is via
[pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip)

```sh
python -m pip install epitools
```

To install the latest development version of `EpiTools` clone this repository
and run

```sh
python -m pip install -e .
```

If working on Apple Silicon make sure to also install the following package from
[conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org).

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge pyqt
```

### Recommended Companion Napari Plugins

To also install the recommended plugins for the `EpiTools` workflow run

```sh
python -m pip install epitools[wf]
```

and

```sh
python -m pip install -e .[wf]
```

When installing with Apple Mac OS X terminal, you might need to add '""' to [wf] as in:

```sh
python -m pip install -e .""[wf]""
```

If working on Apple Silicon make sure to also install the following package from
[conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org)

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge cvxopt
```

which is required for [btrack](https://github.com/quantumjot/btrack).

faser is a Python-based software package designed to simulate the excitation
point spread function (PSF) of optical microscopes. Faser  calculates PSFs for high NA
focusing by using a vectorial model of the electromagnetic field, enabling exploration of the impact
of geometrical and optical parameters on imaging performance in advanced applications. The
software supports various beam profiles, including those used in STED microscopy, and allows for
the simulation of common experimental conditions such as a cranial window and a coverslip tilt.

We provide to prefered ways to use faser:

## Faser as a Napari Plugin

The recommended way to install faser is as a Napari plugin, which provides a user-friendly GUI for interactively exploring the PSF simulation. This can be done via:

```bash
pip install faser napari[pyqt5]
```

#### Usage

You can run the GUI application via (or just as a Napari plugin)

```bash
qtfaser
```

For more information on how to use the GUI, please refer to the [preprint](https://faser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

## Faser as a standalone application

Alternatively, you can install the package as a standalone application only, that you can run in enironments without Napari or GUI support:

```bash
pip install faser[cli]
```
This will install the package as a standalone application that can be run from the command line via:

```bash
faser
```
We generally recommend the GUI application for most users, as it provides a more user-friendly interface.
However faser can also be used as a library, and the CLI application is useful for scripting and batch processing.

#### Usage

To simulate the PSF, with a specific numerical aperture (NA) and a beam profile, you can run the following command:

```bash
faser --na 1.4 --window=NO
```

For more information and options you can run:

```bash
faser --help
```

To display the GUI interface and the available options:

**Napari plugin to ease manual correction of epithelia segmentation in movies.**

To analyse individual cell trajectory from epithelia movies marked for cell-cell junctions, a very precise segmentation and tracking is required.
Several tools such as TissuAnalyzer, Epyseg, CellPose or Dist2Net perform very good segmentation (~5% of errors). 
However, this still implies a high amount of cells to correct manually. 
EpiCure allows to decrease the burden of this task. 
Several features are proposed to ease the manual correction of the segmented movies, such as error detection, numerous shortcuts for editing the segmentation, option for tracking, display and measure/export options.
EpiCure detect segmentation errors by taking advantage of temporal information. 
When a correction is done at a given frame, EpiCure relink the track to adjust for the changes.

```
pip install epicure
``` 

Then launch `Napari`, and the plugin should be visible in the `Plugins` list.

If you already have an environment with `Napari` installed, you can also install it directly in `Napari>Plugins>Install/Uninstall plugins`

### Install code
To have the code to be able to modify it, clone this repository. You can use `pip install -e .` so that everytime you update the code, the plugin will be updated. 

## Dependencies

The input files of EpiCure can be already tracked or not.
Tracking options are proposed in EpiCure:
* Laptrack centroids
* Laptrack overlaps

## Usage
Refer to the [wiki](https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/gletort/epicure/-/wikis/Home) for documentation of the different steps possible in the pipeline.

A plugin for foreground vegetation segmentation, tailored for trellised vegetation row images. It uses RGB images to perform inference and allows users to manually refine the generated mask.

----------------------------------

The method was developped by Herearii Metuarea, PHENET PhD at LARIS (French laboratory located in Angers, France) and Abdoul Djalil Ousseini Hamza, AgroEcoPhen Engineer at IRHS (French Institute located in INRAe Angers, France) in Imhorphen team (bioimaging research group lead) under the supervision of Eric Duchêne (Research Engineer), Morgane Roth (Research Engineer) and David Rousseau (Full professor). This plugin was written by Herearii Metuarea and was designed in the context of the european project PHENET.

    pip install git+https://github.com/hereariim/frontveg.git

GPU is mandatory for time processing and models running (especially Grounding-DINO). Please visit the official PyTorch website to get the appropriate installation command: 👉 https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally

**Exemple : GPU (CUDA 12.1)**

    pip install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121

## Description

This plugin is a tool to perform image inference. This plugin contained two steps of image processing. First, from RGB image, a depth map is estimated and then thresholded based on the estimated depth histogram modes to detect foreground and background regions in image. Second, a Grounding DINO model detects foliage in the foreground. The output is a binary mask where white colour are associated to foliage in the foreground.

The plugin is applicable to images of trellised plants; in this configuration, it has been applied to images of pome fruit trees (apple), stone fruit trees (apricot) and climbing plants (grapevine).

A plugin to find the best ellipsoid to fit a set of points clicked by the user.
With just a few clicks (10 is the absolute minimum) around the cells/nuclei boundaries, the plugin fits an ellipsoid and returns its parameters. 
This can be used to analyze tissue geometry, mecanical stress, provide training databases for segmentation algorithms,...

https://github.com/napari/napari-plugin-template#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/stable/plugins/index.html
-->

## Installation

You can install `fitellipsoid` via [pip]:

    conda create -n fitellipsoid-env python=3.11
    conda activate fitellispoid-env
    pip install -U 'napari[all]'
    pip install fitellipsoid
    napari

## 🧪 Usage Instructions

1. **Open your 3D image stack** in Napari.

2. **Launch the FitEllipsoid plugin** from the plugin menu.

3. **Select the point layer** created by the plugin and begin clicking along the boundary of your object:
   - 🖱️ **Left-click** to add a point  
   - 🖱️ **Right-click** to remove the last added point  

4. **Once you've added at least 10 points**, click on the **""Fit Ellipsoid""** button.

5. A **blue ellipsoid** will be fitted and displayed.  
   - ✅ If the shape fits well, you're done with that object.  
   - ❌ If it doesn't, return to the corresponding point layer and add or adjust points.

6. **Repeat** the process for all objects you'd like to segment.  
   The plugin automatically adds a new point layer after each fit.

7. When you're finished, **save the results** as a `.csv` file and optionally export a segmentation mask.

## Installation

You can install `fish-scan` via [pip]:

    pip install fish-scan



To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/ariannaravera/fish-scan.git


## Tutorial

### 1. Color correction

With this tool you can correct colors in your image.

1.	Open your image in napari by grabbing and dropping it or opening from the menu
2.	Click on “Select the area” to select a rectagular area of the color you wanna correct
3.	Draw the rectangle in the area in which you have that color, eg. white area, as in the example below
4.	Select the color name in the dropdown box, eg. in this case white
5.	Click on “Correct color”
6.	If you’re satisfied of the correction made, it is IMPORTANT to select as input “Image”(first box) the name of the new generated image (usually, “Currect_corrected_...)*
7.	Cuntinue your colors corrections re-starting from step 2

#### Nomenclature:
- you MUSH have your original image with its original name (in this case “Group2_FishID_25April…”)
- then, once you start correcting the image, the new generated images will be called as “Current_corrected_*original-name*”
- if you perform the correction more times, your previous corrected image will be named “Previous_corrected_*original-name*” and the new generated always “Current_corrected_*original-name*”.

This allows you to keep as “previous” the result that you already liked and approved, while the “current” you can play and experiment new corrections. 
Be aware that if you select as input image of the correction “previous” this means that you didn’t like the “current” one and it will be overwrite (while the “previous” remain the same), otherwise if you liked the “current” and you use it as input image of the new correction, then the “current” will become “previous” and the new result “current”.
At anytime if you want you can re-start from the original image by selecting it as input image (original image is NEVER changed).
 
### 2. Set Scale
With this tool you can automatically measure your fish if a scale is in the image.

1.	Click on “Select 1 cm” and draw a line on the scale represeting 1cm, as in this example:
 
2.	Click on “Set scale” and your fish will be automaticall measure in your final analysis with this scale
 
### 3. Segmentation & Analysis
With this tool you can segment your fish.

Steps:
1.	Select the “Image” you want to analyse (be aware of the nomenclature*)
2.	Click “Select fish area” button
3.	Start drawing your mask with the brush (yellow arrow below). I suggest to start drwaing the fish contours and then with the paint bucket (red arrow below) fill the inside. Adjust it with the eraser (orange arrow below) if needed
    
4.	Select the output folder you want the results saved in by clicking “Browse”
5.	Finally, click on “Analyse the fish” to generate your analysis

Here is an example of the results you obtain from it:
•	two graphs per image,
o	one representing the percentage of the 3 dominant color you want to study (black, white and orange) 
 
o	one with the composition of the real RGB values found in the image (the ones that are categorized in the 3 main classes you have in graph 1)
 

•	one csv file in which there are the number of black, white and orange pixels, their percentages (same values of graph 1), the length of the fish in pixels (always provided) and the length converted in cm (if a scale was provided).
o	If in the output folder chosen there were already a previously created csv we will append to that the new info, otherwise a new csv is created.

**A napari plugin for making image annotation using feature space of vision transformers and random forest classifier.**  
We developed a *napari* plugin to train a *Random Forest* model using extracted features of vision foundation models and just a few scribble labels provided by the user as input. This approach can do the segmentation of desired objects almost as well as manual segmentations but in a much shorter time with less manual effort.  

----------------------------------

## Documentation
You can check the documentation [here](https://juglab.github.io/featureforest/) (⚠️ work in progress!).

A plugin for guanine crystal segmentation and classification in the zebrafish eye. More precisely, it provides a workflow that measures on guanine crystal labels and sorts out overlaying partially segmented crystals during classification.

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/plugins/index.html
-->

## Usage 

This plugin is suited for users who
- want to derive size-, shape and intensity-based parameters from individual guanine crystals
- struggle with partially segmented or overlapping crystals
- want to investigate further the size and shape of these guanine crystals

This plugin is not suited for users who 
- are interested in further investigations of intensity of guanine crystals

You can find the plugin in napari under `Plugins` → `guanine-crystal-analysis`

### Image Input

This plugin can be used on individual 2D slices of z-stacks as the workflow was developed on such input.
Therefore, the quality of the result might differ on differing input, like crops or maximum projections.

### 1. Normalization

You can normalize the image selecting `Normalization` where you only need to specify your input image and click on the `Run` button. 

![](img/plugin/normalization.png)

Normalizing the image helps to adjust the intensity values and needs to be applied here because the object segmenter is only trained on normalized images.

### 2. Segmentation

When selecting `Segmentation`, you need to select the normalized image and a minimum pixel count of label images and click on the `Run` button again.
![](img/plugin/segmentation.png)
This avoids having too small and unhelpful labels and is set by default to 50 pixels. 
For the training of the model, an [APOC](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/apoc) pixel classifier was used.

### 3. Analyze Image

Under `Analyze Image`, you can extract features from your image and label image by selecting them and clicking on the `Run` button.  
![](img/plugin/analyzeimage.png)
The extracted features are a combination of the two libraries [napari-skimage-regionprops](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-skimage-regionprops) and [napari-simpleitk-image-processing](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-simpleitk-image-processing). They can be devided into size-, shape-, and intensity-based parameters: 

| **size** | **shape**                 | **intensity**  
|----------|---------------------------|-------------------|
|![](img/plugin/size.png)      	|![](img/plugin/shape.png)              	|![](img/plugin/intensity.png)  	|
| area     	| aspect ratio              	| maximum intensity 	|
|          	| perimeter                 	| mean intensity    	|
|          	| major-axis-length         	| minimum intensity 	|
|          	| minor-axis-length         	| median            	|
|          	| circularity               	| sum               	|
|          	| solidity                  	| variance          	|
|          	| eccentricity              	|                   	|
|          	| roundness                 	|                   	|
|          	| perimeter-on-border       	|                   	|
|          	| perimeter-on-border-ratio 	|                   	|

You can find a glossary with an explanation of these features [in this blog post](https://focalplane.biologists.com/2023/05/03/feature-extraction-in-napari/)
Some of the guanine crystals are not correctly segmented because of overlay or interference patterns. This problem is addressed with the help of a classification step demonstrated next

### 4. Classify Objects

You can divide the crystal labels into predicted (blue) and discarded (brown) crystal labels using `Classify Objects`. There you can choose classifiers trained on intensity-, shape- and/or size-based parameters with the help of the checkboxes.
![](img/plugin/classifyobjects.png)
For the training of the model, an [APOC](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/apoc) object classifier was used.
It is recommended to later on not measure the parameters that the classifier was trained on, but other ones.

### 5. Bad Label Exclusion

Now, you can get rid of the discarded (brown) labels for further analysis using `Bad Label Exclusion`. Select the two label images of segmentation and classification result and press the `Run` button again. 
![](img/plugin/badlabelexclusion.png)
The result is a label image with only the predicted (blue) labels which are relabeled sequentially. If you want to derive measurements on these predicted labels, you can just use  `Analyze Image` again.

### ""Analyze Deluxe""

You can also do all the explained steps in one click using the `Analyze Deluxe` function.

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

## Installation

It's recommended to have installed napari and pyqt through conda. 

    conda install napari pyqt

Then to install this plugin via [pip]:

    pip install generate-dense-patches



To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/volume-em/generate-dense-patches.git


## Usage
To use this plugin with napari:
1. Drag and drop an image and/or segmentation mask (tif) into the viewer.
2. Open ""Plugins"" Toolbar and select ""Generate dense patches"" and click ""Generate 2D Patches""

This plugin works to create a lot of 2D training data by generating an $n^3$ cube, rotating every $\theta$ slices and saving every (step size) slice of the generated volume.

3. Make sure the ""save directory box"", ""step size"", ""rotation theta"", and ""patch size"" is filled in

If no point is placed, then the center of the image will be used as the center of the cube. If a point is placed, then the center of the cube will be the point.

4. Press run and wait for the patches to be generated.

A plugin used a convolutional neural network (CNN) to distinguish single platelets, platelet clusters, and white blood cells and performed classical image analysis for each subpopulation individually. Based on the derived single-cell features for each population, a Random Forest (RF) model was trained and used to classify COVID-19 associated thrombosis and non-COVID-19 associated thrombosis.

[Napari][napari] plugin for interactive pixel classification.
Designed to be similar to the pixel classification workflow in [classic ilastik][ilastik].

## Installation

This plugin requires you to use a _conda_ environment. The environment manager conda comes in a few different forms.
If you haven't used conda before, you can find more information in the [conda user guide][conda-user-guide].
You can use whichever variant you prefer, as the resulting environment should be the same, but we recommend the [_mambaforge_][mambaforge] variant as it is usually the fastest.
When using mambaforge, the `mamba` command usually replaces the `conda` command one would otherwise use.

Once you have installed mambaforge, set up a conda environment with napari and the _fastfilters_ package, and then use pip to install _ilastik-napari_:
```shell
mamba create -y -c ilastik-forge -c conda-forge -n my-napari-env napari fastfilters
mamba activate my-napari-env
pip install ilastik-napari
```

Finally, run napari:
```shell
napari
```
That's it! You should be able to find the ilastik-napari plugin in the Plugins menu.

If you prefer to __install napari using pip__ instead of conda:
Make sure to install `napari[all]`.
Unless you want to [choose a PyQt implementation other than _PyQt5_][napari-pyqt], in which case you should leave out the `[all]` extra.

## Usage

As a prerequisite, make sure you understand the [napari basics][napari-quickstart].

1. Open your image, or use a sample in _File - Open Sample_.

   ![Use a sample image](https://ilastik.org/assets/ilastik-napari/image-sample.png ""Use a sample image"")

2. Activate the plugin in the _Plugins_ menu.

   ![Activate the plugin](https://ilastik.org/assets/ilastik-napari/activation.png ""Activate the plugin"")

3. In _layer list_, create a new _Labels_ layer.

   ![Labels layer](https://ilastik.org/assets/ilastik-napari/labels-layer.png ""Labels layer"")

4. In _layers control_, switch to the _paint_ action.

   ![Paint action](https://ilastik.org/assets/ilastik-napari/paint-action.png ""Paint action"")

5. Draw your background labels.

   ![Paint the background](https://ilastik.org/assets/ilastik-napari/draw-background.png ""Paint the background"")

6. Switch to a new label.

   ![Switch label](https://ilastik.org/assets/ilastik-napari/new-label.png ""Switch label"")

7. Draw your foreground labels.

   ![Paint cells](https://ilastik.org/assets/ilastik-napari/draw-cells.png ""Paint cells"")

8. Select output types you need, and click _Run_.

   ![Plugin interface](https://ilastik.org/assets/ilastik-napari/interface.png ""Plugin interface"")

9. The plugin will create one layer for each output type, which you save as normal napari layers.

   ![Example output](https://ilastik.org/assets/ilastik-napari/example.png ""Example output"")

# Hesperos: *Manual Segmentation and Correction* mode
    
 The ***Manual Segmentation and Correction*** mode of the Hesperos plugin is a simplified and optimized interface to do basic 2D manual segmentation of several structures in a 3D image using a mouse or a stylet with a tablet.

    
 <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49953723/193262711-710673f2-5b53-4eb6-a7c7-6dada9d28d92.PNG"" width=""1000px""/>
    
## Import and adjust your image *(use Panel 1)*
The Hesperos plugin can be used with Digital Imaging and COmmunications in Medicine (DICOM), Neuroimaging Informatics Technology Initiative (NIfTI) or Tagged Image File Format (TIFF) images. To improve performances, use images that are located on your own disk.

1. To import data:
    - use the <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49953723/193262334-3c28e733-36ab-4504-9a6d-acd298c15994.PNG"" width=""100px""/> button for *(.tiff, .tif, .nii or .nii.gz)* image files.
    - use the <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49953723/193262624-149a4461-fbac-4498-a2b8-33bdd88e3a9f.PNG"" width=""100px""/> button for a DICOM serie. /!\ Folder with multiple DICOM series is not supported.  
2. After the image has loaded, a slider appears that allows to zoom in/out: <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49953723/193262738-7e6e68a9-0890-4e18-92a9-dbf2168a6bb5.PNG"" width=""100px""/>. Zooming is also possible with the <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49953723/193262725-7d4f7b09-d119-45cf-a9d4-c42c5f848c1a.PNG"" width=""25px""/> button in the layer controls panel. 
3. If your data is a DICOM serie, you have the possibility to directly change the contrast of the image (according to the Hounsfield Unit):
    - by choosing one of the two predefined contrasts: *CT bone* or *CT Soft* in <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49953723/193262708-17e1d301-0a9a-497f-9feb-613e69893c06.PNG"" width=""150px""/>.
    - by creating a custom default contrast with the <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49953723/193262707-466917b4-b885-429b-9924-6481fa6410bb.PNG"" width=""30px""/> button and selecting *Custom Contrast*. Settings can be exported as a .json file with the <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49953723/193262709-e1ad5321-1f60-4b60-a715-7c494670e1cd.PNG"" width=""30px""/> button.
    - by loading a saved default contrast with the <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49953723/193262710-c9f66354-f896-4e59-8718-70e5509875af.PNG"" width=""30px""/> button and selecting *Custom Contrast*.
4. In the bottom left corner of the application you also have the possibility to: 
    - <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49953723/193262716-d9947eb9-d87f-4251-af76-2d906cd36018.PNG"" width=""25px""/>: change the order of the visible axis (for example go to sagittal, axial or coronal planes).
    - <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49953723/193262717-12afbfb1-49ae-4a77-a83e-5bc99850734a.PNG"" width=""25px""/>: transpose the 3D image on the current axis being displayed.


## Layer controls

When data is loading, two layers are created: the *`image`* layer and the *`annotations`* layer. Order in the layer list correspond to the overlayed order. By clicking on these layers you will have acces to different layer controls (at the top left corner of the application). All actions can be undone/redone with the Ctrl-Z/Shift-Ctrl-Z keyboard shortcuts. You can also hide a layer by clicking on its eye icon on the layer list.
    
    
<ins>For the *image* layer:</ins>
- *`opacity`*: a slider to control the global opacity of the layer.
- *`contrast limits`*: a double slider to manually control the contrast of the image (same as the <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49953723/193262708-17e1d301-0a9a-497f-9feb-613e69893c06.PNG"" width=""150px""/> option for DICOM data).
    

<ins>For the *annotations* layer:</ins>
- <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49953723/193262718-30882770-59eb-4d2b-9cfe-8b88537560c4.PNG"" width=""25px""/>: erase brush to erase all labels at once (if *`preserve labels`* is not selected) or only erase the selected label (if *`preserve labels`* is selected).
- <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49953723/193262722-6bb6e6a4-ae7a-4ad1-b7f8-898e54ad62c3.PNG"" width=""25px""/>: paint brush with the same color than the *`label`* rectangle.
- <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49953723/193262719-f816b21e-78fd-4ba7-b415-30a461cbd652.PNG"" width=""25px""/>: fill bucket with the same color than the *`label`* rectangle.
- <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49953723/193262725-7d4f7b09-d119-45cf-a9d4-c42c5f848c1a.PNG"" width=""25px""/>: select to zoom in and out with the mouse wheel (same as the zoom slider at the top right corner in Panel 1).
- *`label`*: a colored rectangle to represent the selected label.  
- *`opacity`*: a slider to control the global opacity of the layer.  
- *`brush size limits`*: a slider to control size of the paint/erase brush.    
- *`preserve labels`*: if selected, all actions are applied only on the selected label (see the *`label`* rectangle); if not selected, actions are applied on all labels.
- *`show selected`*: if selected, only the selected label will be display on the layer; if not selected, all labels are displayed.
   
    
>*Remark*: a second option for filling has been added
>1. Drawn the egde of a closed shape with the paint brush mode.  
>2. Double click to activate the fill bucket.  
>3. Click inside the closed area to fill it.  
>4. Double click on the filled area to deactivate the fill bucket and reactivate the paint brush mode.
    

## Annotate your image *(use Panel 2)*
    
Manual annotation and correction on the segmented file is done using the layer controls of the *`annotations`* layer. Click on the layer to display them. /!\ You have to choose a structure to start annotating *(see 2.)*.
1. To modify an existing segmentation, you can directy open the segmented file with the <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49953723/193262702-df3b4fb8-63d0-4a1b-b1c9-8391cf8c3f22.PNG"" width=""130px""/> button. The file needs to have the same dimensions as the original image. 
    > /!\ Only .tiff, .tif, .nii and .nii.gz files are supported as segmented files.  
    
2. Choose a structure to annotate in the drop-down menu
    - *`Fetus`*: to annotate pregnancy image.
    - *`Shoulder`*: to annotate bones and muscles for shoulder surgery.
    - *`Shoulder Bones`*: to annotate only few bones for shoulder surgery.
    - *`Feta Challenge`*: to annotate fetal brain MRI with the same label than the FeTA Challenge (see ADD LIEN WEB).
    
> When selecting a structure, a new panel appears with a list of elements to annotate. Each element has its own label and color. Select one element in the list to automatically activate the paint brush mode with the corresponding color (color is updated in the *`label`* rectangle in the layer controls panel).
    
3. All actions can be undone with the <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49953723/193265848-8c458035-609a-433e-aa82-5d9588971425.PNG"" width=""30px""/> button or Ctrl-Z.
    
4. If you need to work on a specific slice of your 3D image, but also have to explore the volume to understand some complex structures, you can use the locking option to facilitate the annotation task.
    - <ins>To activate the functionality</ins>: 
        1. Go to the slice of interest.
        2. Click on the <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49953723/193262706-40f3dbca-5589-406d-81e8-e150ae8bfab6.PNG"" width=""30px""/> button => will change the button to <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49953723/193262703-2b2ea2dc-24fa-438b-a75c-3aa42b210f53.PNG"" width=""30px""/> and save the layer index.
        3. Scroll in the z-axis to explore the data (with the mouse wheel or the slider under the image).
        4. To go back to your slice of interest, click on the <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49953723/193262703-2b2ea2dc-24fa-438b-a75c-3aa42b210f53.PNG"" width=""30px""/> button.

3. *`Automatic segmentation backup`*: if selected, the segmentation data will be automatically exported as a unique 3D image when the image slice is changed.
    > /!\ This process can slow down the display if the image is large.

# Hesperos: *OneShot Segmentation* mode
    
 The ***OneShot Segmentation*** mode of the Hesperos plugin is a 2D version of the VoxelLearning method implemented in DIVA (see [our Github](https://github.com/DecBayComp/VoxelLearning) and the latest article [Guérinot, C., Marcon, V., Godard, C., et al. (2022). New Approach to Accelerated Image Annotation by Leveraging Virtual Reality and Cloud Computing. _Frontiers in Bioinformatics_. doi:10.3389/fbinf.2021.777101](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fbinf.2021.777101/full)).
    

The principle is to accelerate the segmentation without prior information. The procedure consists of:
1. A **rapid tagging** of few pixels in the image with two labels: one for the structure of interest (named positive tags), and one for the other structures (named negative tags).
2. A **training** of a simple random forest classifier with these tagged pixels and their features (mean, gaussian, ...).
3. An **inference** of all the pixels of the image to automatically segment the structure of interest. The output is a probability image (0-255) of belonging to a specific class.
4. Iterative corrections if needed.
    
<img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49953723/193262714-8699cd59-3825-4d71-b27a-bbcad1e36d55.PNG"" width=""1000px""/>

    
## Import and adjust your image *(use Panel 1)*
    
Same panel as the *Manual Segmentation and Correction* mode *(see [panel 1 description](#import-and-adjust-your-image-use-panel-1))*.
   
    
## Annotate your image *(use Panel 2)*
    
Annotations and corrections on the segmented file is done using the layer controls of the *`annotations`* layer. Click on the layer to display them. Only two labels are available: *`Structure of interest`* and *`Other`*. 

The rapid manual tagging step of the one-shot learning method aims to learn and attribute different features to each label.
<img align=""right"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49953723/193262735-5dce56fb-8a2c-4aeb-9ee7-9727122d8089.PNG"" width=""220px""/> 
To achieve that, the user has to:
- with the label *`Structure of interest`*, tag few pixels of the structure of interest.
- with the label *`Other`*, tag the greatest diversity of uninteresting structures in the 3D image (avoid tagging too much pixels).

> see the exemple image with *`Structure of interest`* label in red and *`Other`* label in cyan.
    
1. To modify an existing segmentation, you can directy open the segmented file with the <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49953723/193266118-dfd241f6-8f0b-4cb9-94e7-5e74a3ce8b6e.PNG"" width=""130px""/> button. The file needs to have the same dimensions as the original image. 
    > /!\ Only .tiff, .tif, .nii and .nii.gz files are supported as segmented files. 
2. All actions can be undone with the <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49953723/193265848-8c458035-609a-433e-aa82-5d9588971425.PNG"" width=""30px""/> button or Ctrl-Z.

    
## Run automatic segmentation *(use Panel 3)*

From the previously tagged pixels, features are extracted and used to train a basic classifier : the Random Forest Classifier (RFC). When the training of the pixel classifier is done, it is applied to each pixel of the complete volume and outputs a probability to belong to the structure of interest.

To run training and inference, click on the <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49953723/193262731-719c226a-f7c5-4252-b2bb-fade4ab7f5b3.PNG"" width=""115px""/> button:
1. You will be asked to save a .pckl file which corresponds to the model.
2. A new status will appears under the *Panel 4* : *`Computing...`*. You must wait for the message to change to: *`Ready`* before doing anything in the application (otherwise the application may freeze or crash).
3. When the processing is done, two new layers will appear:
    - the *`probabilities`* layer which corresponds to the direct probability (between 0 and 1) of a pixel to belong to the structure of interest. This layer is disabled by default, to enable it click on its eye icon in the layer list.
    - the *`segmented probabilities`* layer which corresponds to a binary image obtained from the probability image normed and thresholded according to a value manually defined with the *`Probability threshold`* slider: <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49953723/193262730-6998c8a5-92f1-4ff1-bbf5-6972a373afd2.PNG"" width=""80px""/>.

>Remark: If the output is not perfect, you have two possibilities to improve the result:
>1. Add some tags with the paint brush to take in consideration unintersting structures or add information in critical areas of your structure of interest (such as in thin sections). Then, run the training and inference process again. /!\ This will overwrite all previous segmentation data.
>2. Export your segmentation data and re-open it with the *Manual Annotation and Correction* mode of Hesperos to manually erase or add annotations.
    
    
## Export annotations *(use Panel 4)*
    
1. Segmented probabilites can be exported as .tif, .tiff, .nii or .nii.gz file with the <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49953723/193262734-57159a97-2f46-4aba-b3bf-b55a35dfacbd.PNG"" width=""105px""/> button. The image is exported as a unique 3D binary image (value 0 and 255). This file can be re-opened in the application for correction.
2. Probabilities can be exported as .tif, .tiff, .nii or .nii.gz file with the <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49953723/193262733-26e37392-55b2-4c36-9287-b2f5d8d30e03.PNG"" width=""105px""/> button as a unique 3D image. The probabilities image is normed between 0 and 255.
3. <img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/49953723/193266056-9514b648-b3e0-43f5-901a-a45fa1390f00.PNG"" width=""100px""/>: delete annotation data.

napari plugin for iteratively improving a deep learning-based unet-watershed segmentation. 

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/docs/plugins/index.html
-->

## Installation
Install iterseg using pip. Assuming you have python and pip installed (e.g., via miniconda), you can install iterseg with only one line, typed into terminal (MacOS/Linux) or annaconda prompt (Windows). We recomend installing into a [new environment](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#) as some of our dependencies may not play well in the sandpit with certain versions of packages that may exist in a prexisting one. 

```bash
pip install iterseg napari
```


## Opening iterseg
Once `iterseg` is installed, you can access it through the napari viewer, which you can open from the command line (e.g., terminal (MacOS), anaconda prompt (Windows), git bash (Windows), etc.). To open napari simply type into the command line:
```bash
napari
```

## Loading data
Once you've opened napari, you can load image, labels, or shapes data through the `load_data` widget. to open the widget go to **plugins/iterseg/load_data** at the top left of your screen (MacOS) or viewer (Windows). 

 ![find the widgets](https://github.com/AbigailMcGovern/iterseg/blob/main/docs/images/load_data_find.png)

Once the widget appears at the right of the napari window, enter the name you want to give the data you are loading (this will appear in the layers pannel on the left of the window). Choose the type of layer you want to load (Image, Labels, or Shapes: segmentations are loaded as labels layer). You can load a folder of files or a zarr file using ""choose directory"" (zarrs are recognised as a folder of files) or you can load a tiff file using ""choose file"". You can tell the program what the scale of the 3D frames will be in (in the format (z, y, x)).

 ![load data](https://github.com/AbigailMcGovern/iterseg/blob/main/docs/images/load_data.png)

If you are using a single image file (3D, 4D, 5D - ctzyx) or a directory of 3D images (zyx), for ""data type"" choose ""individual frames"". If you are using a directory of 4D images (tzyx) choose ""image stacks"". If you are loading a file that is 4D or 5D and want to load time points (4D: tzyx, czyx) or channels (5D: ctzyx) as individual layers, select ""split channels"". 

## Segmenting images

You can segment data using the ""segment_data"" widget, which can be found at **plugins/iterseg/segment_data**. Once the widget appears, you can choose (1) the image layer you want to segment, (2) the folder into which to save the data, (3) the name you want to give the output file, (4) the type of segmentation to use, (5: optionally) the path to a neural network or configuration file, (6: optionally) a layer produced during training which contains metadata pointing to the trained neual network, (7) chunk size (the size of the neural network input), (8) margin (the margin of overlap between chunks). There is also an optional tickbox for debugging. If this is selected, errors will be easier to identify but you won't be able to interact with the viewer until the segmentation is done. 

 ![segmentation in progress](https://github.com/AbigailMcGovern/iterseg/blob/main/docs/images/segmenting_in_progress.png)

  ![segmented data](https://github.com/AbigailMcGovern/iterseg/blob/main/docs/images/segmented_data.png)

Segmented images can be used to more quickly generate ground truth for training, to assess segmentation quality, or for downstream analyses. 

### Segmentation algorithms
#### Affinity U-Net Watershed
The affinity U-net watershed is a feature based instance segmentation algorithm. A trained U-net predicts an edge affinity graph (basically boundaries in the x, y, and z axes), a map of centre points, and a mask that specifies which pixesl belong to objects. The feature map is fed to a modified watershed algorithm. The object centres are used to find seeds for the watershed and the affinity graph is used to find bounaries between objects. If you train a network using `iterseg`, you can select the outputted network file to segment. Otherwise, if one is not selected, a network we have trained to detect platelets will be used. This might be appropriate for small objects with high anisotropy. 

#### DoG Blob Segmentation
The DoG blob segmentation uses a difference of Gaussian (DoG) filter to find blob shaped objects. The DoG filter is used to find object seeds, a foreground mask, and is fed to a watershed to label objects. This algorithm cannot be trained but can be configured with a configuration file. An example configuration file can be seen in the example folder in this repository. Please see the Segmentation_config.md file for more details. 

## Generating ground truth
We include two tools that are useful for generating ground truth: ""save frames"" and ""ground truth from ROI"". 

### Save frames

The first tool is ""save frames"" can be found at **plugins/iterseg/save_frames**. It enables you to save frames of interest from a  series of segmented images or timeseries. 

 ![save frames](https://github.com/AbigailMcGovern/iterseg/blob/main/docs/images/save_frames.png)

### Ground truth from ROI

The ""ground truth from ROI"" tool can be found at **plugins/iterseg/ground_truth_from_ROI**. This tool enables you to take a small portion of corrected data and place it into a new frame, which can be used for training. The new data can be tiled in the new frame to overrepresent the data in the training data set. At present, the ROI must be selected by adding a shapes layer (added using the icon circled in orange), then adding a rectangle (blue circle).

 ![make an ROI](https://github.com/AbigailMcGovern/iterseg/blob/main/docs/images/generate_ROI.png)

 The rectangle will be used to select a region of the xy-plane. This can be seen in 3D below. 

 ![2D ROI in 3D](https://github.com/AbigailMcGovern/iterseg/blob/main/docs/images/roi_before_3D.png)

 At present, the entire z stack above and below the rectangle will be used to generate ground truth. We aim to incorporate 3D bounding boxes in the future. If multiple ROIs are selected, multiple new image frames will be made, each with a single ROI. When you generate ground truth from the shapes layer, you are able to select the desired shapes layer, image layer, and labels layer. Additionally, you can choose how many times you want to tile the ROI and how much padding to leave between. Tiling will start at the top right and progress right before moving to the next row. You will also be able to choose the save name and the folder into which to save the data. 

 ![ground truth from ROI](https://github.com/AbigailMcGovern/iterseg/blob/main/docs/images/gt_from_ROI.png)

## Training a network
`iterseg` includes a widget for training a u-net for the u-net affinity watershed. The training widget can be found at **plugins/iterseg/train_from_viewer**. Before training, you will need to load the images and ground truth you want to train from. The images and ground truth should each be a series of 3D frames that are stacked into a layer (we suggest loading from a series of frames in a directory). Once loaded, you are able to select a layer as the ground truth and a layer as the image data. You can tell the program what the scale of the output frames will be (in the format (z, y, x)). You can select what type of center prediction to use (we suggest centredness), what type of prediction to use for the mask, and what extent of affinities you want to train (if n = 1, the network will predict only the direct boundaries between objects in each axis, if greater than 1 the network will still predict the direct boundaires but will also predict where there is a new object n steps away - can be used as collateral learning to enhance training). Affinities extent is developmental. Please submit an issue for any problems. 

 ![train from viewer](https://github.com/AbigailMcGovern/iterseg/blob/main/docs/images/train_from_viewer.png)

For the U-net training, we allow you to choose the learning rate for the [ADAM optimiser](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980) used to train the network. You can also choose between binary cross entropy loss ([BCELoss](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/generated/torch.nn.BCELoss.html)) and Dice loss ([DICELoss](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.03237v3)). We have found in our data that BCE loss works better. You can also choose how many chunks of data are produced from each frame (n each) and how many epochs you want to train for the training will be done in n_each * n_frames batches with a minibatch size of 1. 

In the future we hope to expand this training widget to enable training other types of networks. Please get involved if you feel you can help with this. 

## Assessing segmentations
`iterseg` includes widgets for assessing and comparing segmentations. If you want to assess segmentation quality, you will need to load a ground truth and a segmentation to assess. Once loaded, you can select the ground truth and segmentation (model segmentation) using the widget found in **plugins/iterseg/assess_segmentation**. You can select which metrics you want to assess. The metrics we enable are:
- **Variation of information (VI):** VI is a two part measure. It includes a measure of undersegmentation and oversegmentation. Undersegmentation is a measure of the amount of new information you get from looking at the ground truth if you have already seen the segmentation. It can be interpreted as the proportion of objects that are incorrectly merged. Oversegmentation is a measure of the amount of new information you get from looking at the segmentation if you have already seen the ground truth. It can be interpreted as the proportion of objects that are incorrectly split. For more info please see the [scikit-image documentation](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/api/skimage.metrics.html#skimage.metrics.variation_of_information). 
- **Object count difference (OD):** Object count difference is simply the difference in number of objects between a ground truth and the assessed segmentation (card(ground truth) - card(segmentation)). 
- **Average precision (AP):** Average precision  Average precision is a combined measure of how accurate the model is at finding true positive (real) objects (we call this precision) and how many of ground truth real objects it found (this is called recall). The assessment of whether an object is TP, FP, and FN depends on the threashold of overlap between objects. Here we use the intersection of union (IoU), which is the proportion of overlap between the bounding boxes of ground truth and model segemented objects. AP is assessed using different IoU thresholds (from 0.35-0.95). The resultant data will be plotted as IoU by AP. 

  - Precision = TP / (TP + FP)Recall = TP / (TP + FN). 
  - Abbreviations: FN, false negative; TP, true positive; FP, false

Interactive in silico fate mapping from tracking data.

This napari plugin estimates the cell fates from tracking data by building a radial regression model per time point. The user can select an area of interest using a `Points` layer; the algorithm will advent the probed coordinates forward (or backward) in time, showing the estimated fate.

Video example below:

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/21022743/216478216-89c1c35f-2ce4-44e8-adb8-9aeea75b5833.mp4

## Installation

We suggest you create a fresh conda environment to avoid conflicts with your existing package.
To do this, you need to:

    conda create -n fatemap python=3.11
    conda activate fatemap

And then, you can install `in-silico-fate-mapping` via [pip] and other additional useful packages:

    pip install napari-ome-zarr napari[all] in-silico-fate-mapping

To install the latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/royerlab/in-silico-fate-mapping.git


## IO file format

This plugin does not depend on a specific file format, the only requirement is using a `Track` layer from napari.

Despite this, we ship a reader and writer interface. It supports `.csv` files with the following reader `track_id, t, (z), y, x`, `z` is optional.
Such that each tracklet has a unique `track_id` and it's composed of a sequence o time and spatial coordinates.

This is extremely similar to how napari store tracks, more information can be found [here](https://napari.org/stable/howtos/layers/tracks.html).

Divisions are not supported at the moment.

## Usage Example

### Minimal example

Minimal example using a track file following the convention described above.

```python3
import napari
import pandas as pd
from in_silico_fate_mapping.fate_mapping import FateMapping

tracks = pd.read_csv(""tracks.csv"")

fate_map = FateMapping(radius=5, n_samples=25, bind_to_existing=False, sigma=1)
fate_map.data = tracks[[""track_id"", ""t"", ""z"", ""y"", ""x""]]

source = tracks[tracks[""t""] == 0].sample(n=1)

tracks = fate_map(source[[""t"", ""z"", ""y"", ""x""]])

napari.view_tracks(tracks)
napari.run()
```

### Zebrahub example

Zebrafish embryo tail example. This example requires the package `napari-ome-zarr`.

```python3
import napari
import pandas as pd
from in_silico_fate_mapping import FateMappingWidget

image_path = ""http://public.czbiohub.org/royerlab/zebrahub/imaging/single-objective/ZSNS001_tail.ome.zarr""
tracks_path = ""http://public.czbiohub.org/royerlab/zebrahub/imaging/single-objective/ZSNS001_tail_tracks.csv""

viewer = napari.Viewer()
viewer.window.add_dock_widget(FateMappingWidget(viewer))

viewer.open(image_path, plugin=""napari-ome-zarr"")

tracks = pd.read_csv(tracks_path)
viewer.add_tracks(tracks[[""track_id"", ""t"", ""z"", ""y"", ""x""]])
viewer.add_points(name=""Markers"", ndim=4)

napari.run()
```

3D lasso tool to select large 3D areas

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.


## Lasso tool

This repository allows to draw 3D lassos, generate masks from these, and then mask out the image.
For instructions on how to use the plugin, please refer to the [Usage instructions](./docs/Usage.md).

<div style=""text-align: center;"">
<img src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88851e09-6f10-4219-9b45-6f608c3e10b6"" alt=""lasso_gif"" width=""75%"" />
</div>

How it works: A polygon is drawn and a mask is generated via:
### Mask via rotation
Steps:
1. Rotate and project polygon to 2D and create a pixel mask
2. Create a 3D mask by stacking the pixel mask along z
3. Rotate 3D mask s.t. it is aligned with the original polygon

This performed more efficiently than the other methods:

### Mask via projection
Steps:
1. Project all points onto the hyperplane defined by the polygon
2. Rotate all points and the polygon s.t. they are in a horizontal plane and remove z component
3. Create a binary pixel mask of the polygon
4. Check which point projections are within the polygon mask
5. reshape mask to original tomogram size

### Mask via mesh voxelization
Steps:
1. Move polygon along its normal in both directions until end of tomogram shape --> front & back polygons
2. Define a surface by combining front & back polygons into a triangular mesh
3. Voxelize the surface, giving the outline of the cone
4. Fill holes to receive a filled cone

### Mask via attaching slices
Steps:
1. Rotate and project polygon to 2D and generate a pixel mask (2D)
2. Get indices of pixel mask and rotate them back to 3D space
3. Do that for many pixel mask, varying the z-component --> will be moved into tomogram along the polygon normal
4. Binary closing to get rid of holes from integer conversion

## Cellpose

Images can be segmented with custom and built-in cellpose models.

![kép](https://github.com/Nanobiosensorics/microscope-napari/assets/65455148/82d300b9-c523-4b0a-bf44-0f3bfdadae07)

For further information make sure to check out [cellpose](https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose) and [cellpose-napari](https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose-napari) plugin.

## Cell counting

Cell counts in pictures can be obtained with cellpose models and average intensity regression models.
Any number of napari image layers can be selected to be evaluated.

### Cellpose model

Without enabling regression model counting the default used method is cellpose segmenting.
The lower settings are for cellpose only.

Cell masks can be output to verify the accuracy of results.

Our custom cellpose models can be accessed [there](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-2SRK_AIlcSODebPoigKA7kbn5cb5s2o?usp=sharing).

![kép](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00d1336f-eeb4-4074-87a6-70d9cd866c07)

### Average intensity regression model

For these models we should enable the regression model counting feature.
The lower settings are irrelevant now, cell masks will not be output.
It is only used for counting cells in images.

Our regression models can be accessed [there](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-5uAXN1W5lbE2Pw6Tsa1lR5BYqmPgdEP?usp=sharing).

midi-app-controller is an app, that allows user to control all applications using 'pyapp-kit/app-model' with a USB MIDI controller.

## Documentation

Documentation at https://midi-app-controller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

## Usage (napari)

MIDI App Controller is a package designed to integrate MIDI controllers with Python Qt apps using app-model. As of now, it is used most commonly with [napari](https://napari.org), a viewer for multi-dimensional images. We will show how to use MIDI App Controller with napari but getting started with other applications should look very similar.

### Installation

To install MIDI App Controller in your environment (where Python and napari are already installed), use this command:

```
pip install midi-app-controller
```

napari will automatically detect the package and install the plugin next time it starts.

To install the newest development version, clone the GitHub repo and [install it as a local package](#installing).

### Setup

Launch the plugin from the _Plugins_ menu.

![](docs/img/plugins-menu.png)

A panel will open to the side.

![](docs/img/midi-status.png)

#### Controller

If your MIDI controller is supported out of the box, you can simply select the appropriate model. If not, you will need to tell MIDI App Controller how to interact with this model of controller by creating a [controller schema](controllers.md).

Once you have selected the controller schema, you can select binds schema.

#### MIDI ports

If they haven't been selected automatically, select MIDI input and output ports that correspond to your physical controller.

### Start handling

After a controller and bindings are selected, you can click ""Start handling"". This will start a thread that listens to all input from the controller and invokes appropriate commands. You can close the panel with the settings, the thread will work in the background until you click ""Stop handling"".

### Edit binds

Click ""Edit binds"" to open dialog where you can configure bindings by choosing which physical buttons and knobs on your controller correspond to which commands in the application. Think of it like configuring keyboard shortcuts.

![](docs/img/edit-binds.png)

All configurations are simple YAML files which you can copy, share, or edit manually. You can click ""Reveal in explorer"" to see the exact location of the currently chosen config file. You shouldn't edit built-in presets stored in the package directory; when you edit a built-in preset in the graphical user interface, a copy will automatically be created.

After you save changes, if you have already started handling, you need to click ""Restart handling"" to start a new server with the changes applied.

## Usage without GUI

The library can be also controlled using the singleton of [`StateManager`](api_reference.md) class:
```python
from midi_app_controller.state.state_manager import get_state_manager

state = get_state_manager()
# Now the library can be controlled using `state`.
```

## Development

### Installing
```sh
python3 -m pip install -e .
```

### Testing
```sh
python3 -m pip install -e .[testing]
python3 -m pytest --cov .
```

### Testing docs
```sh
mkdocs serve -a localhost:8080
```

### Using pre-commit
```sh
python3 -m pip install -e .[dev]
pre-commit install
```

## 1&nbsp;&nbsp;Overview

**Mitoclass** is a *napari* plugin for the qualitative assessment of mitochondrial network morphology.  
Inference is **patch‑wise**: each 2‑D patch—obtained from a maximum‑intensity projection of 3‑D stacks—is classified as **connected**, **fragmented**, or **intermediate**.

---

## 2&nbsp;&nbsp;Key features

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Patch‑based inference | Analyse an image folder *or* the active napari layer. |
| RGBA heatmaps | Overlay prediction maps as semi‑transparent layers in napari. |
| Global statistics | Compute the proportion of pixels assigned to each morphology and identify the dominant class. |
| 3‑D graph | Interactive Plotly scatter plot of connected / fragmented / intermediate proportions per image. |

---

## 3&nbsp;&nbsp;Requirements

* **Python** ≥ 3.10  
* **OS** : Windows, Linux or macOS  
* **Hardware** : CPU is sufficient; GPU (CUDA 11+) is recommended for large datasets

---

## 4&nbsp;&nbsp;Installation

### 4.1  PyPI

```bash
pip install mitoclass
```

### 4.2  Reproducible *conda* environment

```bash
conda create -n mitoclass python=3.10
conda activate mitoclass

# (Optional) GPU acceleration
conda install -c conda-forge cudnn=8.9 cuda11.8 tensorflow

pip install mitoclass
```

*Apple Silicon*: install `tensorflow-macos`.

### 4.3  Pre‑trained model

Download the model (`.h5`) from  
<https://github.com/Jmlr2/MitoClassif/releases>

---

## 5&nbsp;&nbsp;Usage

### 5.1  Graphical interface

```bash
napari
```

1. Open **Plugins → Mitoclass**.  
2. Select the four required paths:  

   | Field | Purpose |
   |-------|---------|
   | **Input dir** | Folder of images to analyse (`.tif`, `.tiff`, `.stk`, `.png`). |
   | **Output dir** | Destination folder for CSV and graph files. |
   | **Heatmaps dir** | Folder where heatmaps (`*_map.tif`) will be written. |
   | **Model file** | Pre‑trained Keras model (`.h5`). |

3. Click **Run inference**. A progress bar tracks the number of processed images.  
4. After completion:  
   * **Show heatmaps** adds the newly generated `*_map.tif` layers to napari.  
   * **Show 3D graph** opens `graph3d.html`, displaying the connected/fragmented/intermediate proportions.

*Tip*: Without an *Input dir* you may run **Infer active layer**; results are still saved to *Output dir* and *Heatmaps dir*.

### 5.2  Output structure

| Folder | File(s) | Content |
|--------|---------|---------|
| **Output dir** | `predictions.csv` | Pixel proportion for each class (*connected*, *fragmented*, *intermediate*) and the dominant morphology, one line per image. |
|                | `graph3d.html` | Interactive 3‑D Plotly graph of class proportions. |
| **Heatmaps dir** | `*_map.tif` | One RGBA heatmap per image, ready to overlay in napari. |

MMV_H4Tracks (Human4Tracks) is a plugin to use with napari for segmenting and tracking cells, which additionally enables user-friendly manual curation of segmentation and tracks and various options for analyzing and evaluating the results.

We have tested MMV_H4Tracks intensively under Linux and Windows, for Mac there may be problems with parallel computing, which are on our roadmap and will be fixed in a future version.

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

<!-- ## Usage
Load a zarr-file consisting of Image, Label and Tracks layer. -->

## Installation

You can install `mmv_h4tracks` via [pip]:

    pip install mmv_h4tracks


By default, CPU is used for segmentation computing. We did our best to optimize the CPU computing time, but still recommend GPU computing for better performance. For more detailed instructions on how to install GPU support look [here](https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose#gpu-version-cuda-on-windows-or-linux).

<!-- 

To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/MMV-Lab/mmv_h4tracks.git -->


## Documentation
This plugin was developed to analyze 2D cell migration. It includes the function of segmenting 2D videos using [Cellpose](https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose) (both CPU and GPU implemented) and then tracking them using different automatic tracking algorithms, depending on the use case. For both segmentation and tracking, we have implemented user-friendly options for manual curation after automatic processing. In conjunction with napari's inherent functionalities, our plugin provides the capability to automatically track data and subsequently process the tracks in three different ways based on the reliability of the automated results. Firstly, any potentially existing incorrect tracks can be rectified in a user-friendly manner, thereby maximizing the evaluation of available information. Secondly, unreliable tracks can be selectively deleted, and thirdly, individual tracks can be manually or semi-automatically created for particularly challenging data, ensuring reliable results. In addition, the manually curated results can be compared with the automatic results in order to obtain a score for the quality of the automatic results. In essence, our tool aims to offer a valuable supplement to the existing fully automated tracking tools and a user-friendly means to analyze videos where fully automated tracking has been previously challenging.

Common metrics such as speed, cell size, velocity, etc... can then be extracted, plotted and exported from the tracks obtained in this way. Furthermore, the plugin incorporates a functionality to assess the automatic tracking outcomes using a [quality score](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0144959). Since automated tracking may not be consistently 100% accurate, presenting a quality measure alongside scientific discoveries becomes essential. This supplementary metric offers researchers valuable insights into the dependability of the produced tracking results, fostering informed data interpretation and decision-making in the analysis of cell migration.

More detailed information and instructions on each topic can be found in the following sections.

### Get started

To load your raw data, you can simply drag & drop them into napari. Ensure that the 'Image' combobox displays the correct layer afterward, see example: 

![Comboboxes](https://github.com/MMV-Lab/mmv_h4tracks/blob/main/docs/figures/combobox.png?raw=true)

To load your own segmentation, you can do equivalent.

The ""save as"" button can be used to save the existing layers (raw, segmentation, tracks) in a single .zarr file, which can be loaded again later using the ""load"" button. The ""save"" button overwrites the loaded .zarr file.

The computation mode is used to set how many of the available CPU cores (40% or 80%) are to be used for computing the CPU segmentation and tracking and therefore has a direct impact on performance.


### Segmentation

For segmentation, we use the state of the art instance segmentation method Cellpose. We provide a model that we trained and has proven successful for our application ([see more information](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-023-43765-3)).


#### Automatic instance segmentation

To start automatic segmentation, a model must first be selected. Automatic segmentation can then be started via ""Run Segmentation"". The ""Preview"" option offers the possibility of segmenting the first 5 frames first in order to obtain an estimate of the expected results, as the computation - depending on the data and hardware - can be time-consuming.


##### Custom models

The plugin supports adding custom Cellpose models. To do so, simply click on ""Add custom Cellpose model"", enter a name to be displayed, select the model path and pass the required parameters. Click [here](https://cellpose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id0) for more information about the parameters.


To train your own Cellpose model, [this](https://cellpose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/train.html) might be helpful.
In future versions, we plan to support fine-tuning of Cellpose models within the plugin. 


#### Manual curation

We provide different options to correct the automatic segmentation:

- `Remove cell` - Click on a cell to remove it. Be aware that removing a cell will split the track the cell belongs to, potentially affecting subsequent tracking.
- `Next free ID` - Loads the next free label ID, then a false negative cell can be manually annotated using the paint mode.
- `Select ID` - Click on a cell to load its ID, then this cell can be corrected manually using the paint mode.
- `Merge cell` - Click on 2 different fragments of the same cell to harmonize their ID. Note: This has no effect on the annotation itself.
- `Separate` - Click on a cell to assign a new ID to it.


### Tracking

The plugin supports both coordinate-based (LAP) and overlap-based tracking. Overlap-based tracking requires more computation, but can also be used in particularly complicated data for individual cells.
In our experience, coordinate-based tracking has proven itself in cases with reliable segmentation. Overlap-based tracking serves as a useful complement in cases where the segmentation is not of sufficient quality.

If necessary, overlap-based tracking can also be used for single cells. To do this, simply click on the cell after clicking the button.

#### Manual curation

To correct tracks, the plugin allows you to link or unlink them. For both options, first click on the corresponding button and then on the cell in the respective frame. The action must then be confirmed using the previously clicked button, which now displays ""confirm"".

To unlink, all you need to do is click on the cell in the first and last frame. So if the cell is tracked from frame 1-100 and the track between frames 1-10 is to be deleted, it is sufficient to click on the cell in frames 1 and 10. If the track is to be deleted between frames 40-60, it is sufficient to click in frames 40 and 60. In this scenario, the rest of the track is then split, i.e. once into a track from frame 1-40 and once into a track from frame 60-100.

In contrast, to link cells, the corresponding cell in each frame must be clicked. This must be done for all frames, so the track must be gapless.

#### Visualize & filter tracks

The displayed tracks can be filtered by entering specific track IDs. Click on the ""Show all tracks"" button to display all tracks again.

Individual tracks can be deleted using the delete function. Note: These are permanently deleted and cannot be restored without re-tracking. In addition, all displayed tracks can be deleted.

### Analysis

The plugin supports the calculation of various metrics, which can be divided into two categories: migration-based (such as speed, direction, ...) and shape-based (such as size, eccentricity, ...). Through the use of these metrics, a comprehensive understanding of the available data can be obtained.

All these metrics can be exported to a .csv file. In addition, the tracks can be filtered with a movement minimum (in pixels) and a minimum track length (in frames). Note: All existing tracks are exported in any case, but their results are presented separately.
 
The plugin offers the option of filtering the existing tracks according to the metrics. To do this, the corresponding metric can be selected in the plot area and a scatter plot of the data points will be generated using the plot button. Individual data points (/tracks) that are to be displayed can be circled with the mouse and all tracks that are not circled will be hidden. Note: No tracks are deleted in this process. Hiding tracks triggers the filter function in the tracking section, the ""Show all tracks"" button can display all tracks again as described above.


### Evaluation

To be aware of the accuracy of your automatic tracking and segmentation results, we have implemented an option to evaluate your automatic results. Evaluation is always carried out against the latest results of automatic segmentation and automatic tracking or previously created results loaded via the plugin's own load function. We may implement the option to evaluate external segmentations in the future, but for now you can use save and load as a workaround.

To evaluate results, at least two consecutive frames must be manually corrected first. The plugin saves the previously mentioned automatic or loaded results in the background, so no activation via button or similar is necessary before manual correction.

The range of frames to be evaluated can be set, for which the results for segmentation and tracking can be calculated independently of each other. 


#### Segmentation evaluation

In order to evaluate the segmentation results, a segmentation must first be loaded via the plugin's load function (drag & drop via napari is not sufficient) or computed within the plugin. This can then be corrected manually. For IoU, Dice and Average Precision 50 scores are then calculated for the frames specified by the user. These results are not exported automatically and must therefore be noted down by users themselves.

#### Tracking evaluation

As for the evaluation of the segmentation, tracking results loaded via the plugin or obtained within the plugin are required. At least 2 consecutive frames must be corrected manually so that a score can be calculated for the quality of the tracking results. More information can be found [here](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0144959).


### Assistant

The assistant tab serves to facilitate the identification of errors within segmentation and tracking. It is divided into filters and segmentation adaptation.

Recommended filter strategy:
1. ""Show noteworthy tracks"" to discover tracks that are not close to the edge and emerge or disappear after the movie starts. Tracks must be gapless, and resulting hits can be indications of errors.
2. ""Show small cells"" to double-check if there is any noise/pollution segmented.
3. ""Show untracked cells"" to identify untracked segmented instances. 

The other filters can provide additional support.

The segmentation adaptation functions supplement useful functions with respect to segmentation. ""Align segmentation IDs"" adapts the label IDs with regard to the tracking IDs (the label IDs are then no longer arbitrary). ""Relabel cells"" ensures that the labels within a frame are unique, which helps eliminate accidental errors during manual segmentation correction.


## Hotkeys

Here's an overview of the hotkeys. All of them can also be found in the corresponding tooltips. 

- `W` - Load next free segmentation ID
- `G` - Overlap-based single cell tracking 
- `H` - Separate cells
- `Q` - Select cell ID 


## Development plan

We will continue to develop the plugin and implement new features in the future. Some of our plans in arbitrary order:

- Feedback (progress bar) for computationally intensive functions
- Support of lineages
- Support training custom Cellpose models within the plugin
- Model optimization to further optimize segmentation computation
- Support evaluation of external segmentations
- Improve robustness of Mac computing
- ...

## Documentation

This plugin for the graphics software Napari is designed to analyze two-dimensional microscopy images. Images should be provided in grayscale format, as colored images are not supported. The plugin includes seven core functions for image analysis:

1. Intensity normalization  
2. Smoothing  
3. Background correction  
4. Spot-shape filter  
5. Filament-shape filter  
6. Thresholding  
7. Topology-preserving thinning  

We provide an [introduction](https://github.com/MMV-Lab/MMV-playground/blob/main/docs/introduction.md) to explain the different functions of this plugin.

### **How to Start and Use the Plugin**

To start the plugin, open Napari, go to the ""Plugins"" menu, and select ""MMV-playground (MMV-playground)."" The MMV-playground interface will appear on the right-hand side of the Napari window, displaying seven buttons, each corresponding to one of the available functions. Clicking a button opens a dialog box where you can select an image, adjust the parameters for the chosen function, and execute it by pressing the ""Run"" button. Clicking the function button again collapses the dialog box.

### Screenshot

Here is a preview of the MMV-playground plugin in action:

![MMV-playground Plugin Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MMV-Lab/MMV-playground/main/docs/images/plugin_screenshot.png)

---

### **Intensity Normalization**

This function adjusts the image intensity to enhance contrast and improve uniformity. Two percentage values are required:  
- *Lower percentage (0–5%)*: Defines the darkest portion of the image to ignore as background noise, which is set to a fixed value.  
- *Upper percentage (95–100%)*: Specifies the brightest portion of the image to be capped, preventing overexposure.  

The plugin calculates the respective percentiles based on these values. Intensities below the lower percentile are clipped, and those above the upper percentile are also capped. Finally, all pixel intensities are rescaled to the range [0, 1].

---

### **Smoothing**

This function reduces noise to enhance image clarity. Two methods are available:  
- *Gaussian smoothing*  
- *Edge-preserving smoothing*: Retains edges (e.g., cell boundaries) while reducing noise.  

---

### **Background Correction**

This function removes uneven illumination or background artifacts using a filter. The key parameter is:  
- *Kernel size (1–100)*: Determines the spatial scale of the background correction. Smaller kernel sizes remove local noise, while larger sizes correct for broader illumination variations.  

The [scipy.ndimage.white_tophat] function is used to perform the correction, making this method effective for images with dark backgrounds.

---

### **Spot-Shape Filter**

This filter detects circular structures, such as cell nuclei or fluorescent spots. It is based on the [scipy.ndimage.gaussian_laplace] function and requires:  
- *Sigma (σ)*: Controls the size of the spots to detect. Smaller sigma values target smaller spots, while larger values focus on larger structures.

---

### **Filament-Shape Filter**

This filter highlights elongated structures like cytoskeletal fibers or blood vessels. Using the [aicssegmentation.core.vessel.vesselness2D] function, the key parameter is:  
- *Sigma (σ)*: Specifies the width of the detected filaments. Lower values detect thinner structures, while higher values identify thicker ones.

---

### **Thresholding**

This function segments the image into binary regions by separating the signal from the background. Users can choose one of four thresholding methods:  
- *Otsu*: Best for images with clear separation between background and signal intensities.  
- *Li*: Suitable for uniformly illuminated images.  
- *Triangle*: Effective for asymmetrical intensity distributions.  
- *Sauvola*: Ideal for images with uneven illumination.  

The result is a binary image where pixels above the threshold are set to 1 (signal), and all others are set to 0 (background).

---

### **Topology-Preserving Thinning**

This function extracts the skeleton of structures while maintaining their connectivity. Two parameters are required:  
- *Minimum thickness (0.5–5)*: Defines the smallest allowable thickness of structures before thinning.  
- *Thin (1–5)*: Controls the degree of thinning, reducing structure width while preserving topology (e.g., network connections).  

This is particularly useful for analyzing vascular or cellular networks.

---

### **What Is Missing?**

Currently, unit tests are not implemented, and internal documentation of the source code is still in progress.

A simple plugin to help with analyzing cells in napari

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

-->

## Installation

You can install `mmv_h4cells` via [pip]:

    pip install mmv_h4cells



To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/MMV-Lab/mmv_h4cells.git


## Documentation

This plugin was developed for semi-automatic cell analysis to determine cell sizes of individual cells.

The core functionality includes the option to include or exclude individual (cell) instances in the evaluation via the include/exclude button. After a decision has been made, the plugin automatically centers on the next instance and a new decision can be made. In addition, you can include multiple cells at the same time using the ""select multiple"" function. It is also possible to analyze entire ROIs at once.
 
### Get started

To get started, an instance segmentation must be loaded. This can be done simply via drag & drop. A raw image of the original data is optional, but certainly helps when deciding whether to include or exclude.
Once the layers have been loaded into napari, the plugin can be started.
If you have only interrupted the evaluation and exported the previous results, you can now import them again (the segmentation must be reloaded into napari). 

### Analysis

The analysis can be started by clicking on the ""Start analysis"" button. The next instance ID to be evaluated is shown next to ""Start analysis at"". To change the region of interest to be evaluated, a different ID can be entered there and the plugin will center on this within the next 2 decisions. Decisions are made by clicking the Include/Exclude button. If an instance is not completely recognized correctly, you can use the paint function of napari to correct this manually and then include the instance as usual using the button. The undo function can be used to undo the last decision and the ""Draw own cell"" button allows you to add unrecognized cells manually. This must be done cell by cell and confirmed each time using the button. The plugin does not allow other existing instances to be painted over. If this happens by mistake, a warning is displayed, oberlapping pixels are highlighted and users can either cancel via the cancel button within the warning or close the warning and correct this manually. 

When an instance is included, the respective instance is written to a segmentation layer, which can be exported using the export function. In addition, the ID, the size and the centroid are exported as a .csv file. We also export a .zarr file, which makes it possible to re-import previously exported results, for example to pause the analysis. To enable a smooth re-import, the .csv and the .zarr file must have the same name stem, so please either do not rename the files or rename them in the same way. 

For a better overview, the included/excluded/remaining instances can be viewed using the buttons at the bottom.

#### Select multiple cells

We also support the option of including several cells at once. To do so, the respective IDs must be entered at the bottom next to ""Include"" and then selected using the ""Select multiple"". This works by entering comma-separated IDs, so *1,5,100,17* would be a valid entry.

#### Select ROI

Entire ROIs can also be analyzed. To do this, simply enter the corner pixels in the ""Range x"" and ""Range y"" fields. All cells > the threshold are included; if, for example, cells that lie exactly at the edge of the ROI and are partially cut off are to be excluded, a corresponding threshold must be set.

Note: Exported ROIs cannot be re-imported.

### Hotkeys

- `k` - Include
- `g` - Exclude
- `j` - Change visibility of all label layers for better inspection
- `h` - Undo

### Don'ts

This is a tool for analyzing cells. However, we do not catch every possible error and in order for the tool to run stable, it is important to avoid some operations:

- Do not create new layers during the analysis.

A napari plugin for [MiSiC](https://elifesciences.org/articles/65151). Segmentation of bacteria in dense colonies. 
The plugin provides acces to preprocessing of the image like scaling, gamma correction, sharpness and noise variance that can improve the segmentation of bacteria irrespective of the imaging modality.

## Install Napari
Install napari either the bundled app or through [pip/conda]
https://napari.org/#installation

## Installation

Install `misic-napari` through plugin manager in napari.

Or

You can install `misic-napari` via [pip] in the napari console:

    pip install misic-napari

## Tutorial
Note: 
The image should be in the format [n,row,col] or [row,col], i.e., a single image or a stack. Hyper-stacks are not supported yet. 

#### get_width


Creates a Shapes layer with name 'cell-width' where the cell width can be hand drawn using line drawing tools in the shapes layer. This need not be precise and can be adjusted later. Click `get_cell_width` to obtain the desired mean cell width. This will be used to scale the image accordingly before segmentation.
 
#### segment

This can be used to quickly set the parameters that can be later used to segment the whole stack.

```
use_roi
```
A square ROI of side 256 is created by default for quickly checking adjusting the segmentation parameters. The roi can be resized or moved in the `roi` shapes layer.

```
light_background
```
True; for phase-contrast images.

False; for bright-field and fluorescence images.

```
use_local_noise
```
If checked, this adds noise to image with local variance. In this case, a noise_var of around 0.1 works well. If unchecked, this adds noise with global variance of noise_var/100. Adding may help in removing false positives.

```
gaussian_laplace
```
Useful when segmenting fluorescence images. 

```
adjust_scale
```
Fine-tuning the scale around ([0.8,1.2]) the scale obtained from cell-width determined in `get_cell_width`.

```
noise_var
```
Amount of noise to be added to the image at the preprocessing step. This helps reduce the False Positives and, in many cases, to separate cells effectively. 
```
gamma
```
gamma correction 

```
sharpness_scale and sharpness_amount
```
Unsharp mask based sharpness with sigma = sharpness_scale and amount = sharpness_amount



### segment_stack
Segments the entire stack using the parameters that were obtained in ""segment"".


### save
The parameters can be saved in a json file.

Live imaging of microbial communities requires new tools for the robust identification of bacterial cells in dense and often inter-species populations, sometimes over very large scales. Here, we developed MiSiC, a general deep-learning-based 2D segmentation method that automatically segments single bacteria in complex images of interacting bacterial communities with very little parameter adjustment, independent of the microscopy settings and imaging modality. Using a bacterial predator-prey interaction model, we demonstrate that MiSiC enables the analysis of interspecies interactions, resolving processes at subcellular scales and discriminating between species in millimeter size datasets. The simple implementation of MiSiC and the relatively low need in computing power make its use broadly accessible to fields interested in bacterial interactions and cell biology.},

A Napari plugin for the segmentation of regions by flood_fill

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [copier] using the [napari-plugin-template].

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/stable/plugins/index.html
-->

## Installation

You can install `mmv-regionseg` via [pip]:

    pip install mmv-regionseg



To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/MMV-Lab/mmv-regionseg.git

## Documentation

**MMV-RegionSeg** is a Napari plugin designed to segment three-dimensional image data based on the gray value of a selected seed point. Neighboring voxels are assigned to the same class if their intensity is similar to that of the seed point or falls within a defined tolerance range.

---

### Launching the Plugin

1. Open Napari.
2. Go to the **Plugins** menu.
3. Select **MMV-RegionSeg** from the dropdown.

This opens a widget on the right-hand side of the Napari window, featuring several buttons, labels, and a slider.

### Screenshot

Here is a preview of the MMV-RegionSeg plugin in action:

![MMV-RegionSeg Plugin Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MMV-Lab/MMV-RegionSeg/main/docs/images/plugin_screenshot.png)

---

### Loading Image Data

Click the **""Read image""** button to load a 3D image in TIFF format. A standard OS file dialog will open. Once the image is selected, Napari will display it as an **image layer**.

---

### Adjusting Tolerance

A **slider** below the image loading button allows you to set the gray value tolerance (range: **1–50**):

- **Low tolerance**: May result in incomplete region filling.
- **High tolerance**: May include undesired regions.

> ⚠️ Choosing the right tolerance often requires trial and error.

---

### Selecting Seed Points

Click **""Select seed points""** to activate a new **points layer** in Napari. You can then define seed points by clicking directly in the viewer.

- Each seed point is visualized.
- Multiple seed points added in one step are treated as a single class.
- Use Napari’s **Layer Controls** to move or delete seed points.

---

### Segmentation Options

After placing seed points, you can choose between two segmentation methods:

#### Flood

Click **""Flood""** to perform segmentation using  
`skimage.segmentation.flood(...)`.  
This identifies neighboring voxels within the tolerance range and saves them to a new **label layer**.

You can repeat this process for other classes by selecting new seed points. Each class will have its own label layer.

#### Growth

Click **""Growth""** to visualize the segmentation **step by step**.  
This simulates the growth of a region, similar to a cell colony expanding in a Petri dish.

---

### Resetting for New Segmentation

After a label layer is created for a class, the **points layer is removed**, allowing you to define new seed points without affecting the existing segmentation results.

#### 2.1. Calculating mean (average) intensity of selected m/z value
To focus on a specific m/z value, zoom in on the spectrum plot. The figure will be as
shown as below.
![Calculating mean spectrum specific mz_v1](https://github.com/nmmtsaw/MSI-Explorer_User-Manual/assets/127961719/ba47080a-f439-4dc2-96b9-1f82ee5acbc3)

It is recommended to use `Multi` panel view.
The image can be displayed by `Show image` and the data can be exported as `.csv` file by using `Export spectrum data`.

### 3. Pre-processing
The pre-processing capabilities of MSI-Explorer enhance data quality and prepare MSI data for downstream analysis. Pre-processing steps involve: 


#### (a) Noise reduction
Users can choose their desired level of noise reduction (shown as a percentage) for their experiment. 

![Noise reduction_v1](https://github.com/nmmtsaw/MSI-Explorer_User-Manual/assets/127961719/9ce5e428-fe46-4f5f-a53f-7186c9f5ca8c)

#### (b) Normalization
The normalization methods that the user can apply are 
- Total ion current (TIC)
- Root mean square (RMS)
- Medium
- Reference peak (or internal standard)

![normalization_v1](https://github.com/nmmtsaw/MSI-Explorer_User-Manual/assets/127961719/972b30af-8425-46e4-bb54-705df52c725a)

The features of the database function are
1. Charge (neutral, positive or negative)
2. Adduct (based on the charge chosen)
3. Range of the m/z value for the image display
4. custom search with molecule name or m/z value

![Database_search](https://github.com/nmmtsaw/MSI-Explorer_User-Manual/assets/127961719/ca7d943a-1b6b-4cba-bf4d-934ee574cc61)

Users can customize the database with exact mass, molecule name, or molecular formula. The format should be as shown in the table and the headers are not needed in the database.

Exact mass | Molecule name | Molecula formula
------- | -------- | --------
176.0950 | Cotinine | C10H12N2O
174.1117 | Arginine | C6H14N4O2
244.0881 | Biotin | C10H16N2O3S

### 5. Region of interest (ROI) selection
- To select the ROI, click on `Select ROI for mean spectrum`. Adjust the brush size and label color. You can fill the area by using paint icon. 
- Then click on the `Calculate ROI mean spectrum`.
- You can export as `.csv` file by using `Export spectrum data`.
- If one m/z is needed, just zoom-in the spectrum plot window and export.
- Before selecting the second ROI, remove the first selected area by using eraser or label 0.

Registration of 3D multiplex images with one common chanel, based on itk-elastix.

Napari plugin to align 3D stacks that have one common field of view in one chanel used to calculate the alignement. The plugin will apply the registration to all other chanels and output one final stack with all the aligned chanels.

The stacks **must have one common chanel** (typically cell junctions and nuclei) that is used to calculate the registration transformation. It can be rotated, translated, deformed, and with a wider field of view. 
Then the calculated transformation is applied to all the other chanels for each stack.

The final result is **one multi-chanel 3D stack**, with the first chanel being an average (or not) of the common chanel and each other chanel the registered chanels from the multiple stacks. The common chanel can be averaged between the different chanels, which improves its quality.

The plugin save and load files to a folder named `aligned` and created in the same directory as the source images.

Example of usage of this module is in the case of imaging the same cells with washing out or moving the sample in between. The corresponding cells will not be at the same position in the new stacks, and can even be deformed by the procedure. This plugin realign the images based on one common chanel on which the transformation is calculated. 

----------------------------------
## Installation

* You can install the plugin directly in `Napari` by going to `Plugins>Install/Uninstall plugins` and search for `multireg`

* Or you can install `multireg` via [pip]:

    pip install multireg


## Usage

You can launch `multireg` in napari by going to `Plugins>multireg: do multiplex registration`.

### Fixed image
It will open a prompt to ask you to select the reference (fixed) image, compared to which all other images will be aligned.
Then you have to choose the `reference chanel` that will be used in all the stacks to calculate the alignement. So this chanel should be common to all stacks.

![](https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/gletort/multireg/raw/main/imgs/plugin_step0.png)

#### Reference points
The first part of the registration relies on reference points manually selected, because the common field of view can be quite far from each other in the acquisition. So first a affine registration is applied to bring close the region of interest between the two stacks to match. 
<br> *Note that if your stacks did not move a lot then you could calculate the transformation without using the reference points. There's an option in the alignement calculation panel for this.*

![](https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/gletort/multireg/raw/main/imgs/plugin_fixedpoints.png)

You have to manually placed a few reference points (4-5 should be enough). Try to spread them in the image (in x,y and z) on landmarks to recognize them in other images. 

To add a new reference point, click on the ""plus"" sign in the left panel. To select one, click on the arrow icon (or press 3), then on the point. You can move the point in x and y. To move it in z, press `u` for up and `d` for down. 

When all points are placed, save them. The **points have to be saved** to be correctly loaded by the alignement calculation step.
Then click on `Fixed points done` to continue to the next step.


### Moving images
Then you can choose one of the images you want to align with the reference image. Its chanel that is common to the fixed image should be the same chanel, selected in the first step (the `reference chanel`). Select the file of the moving image to align by clicking on `select file`. This will open the new image and go to the step of placing the moving points in this image.

When you will have process all the moving images, you can click on `All done` to finish the plugin by creating the [resulting stack](#create-resulting-image).

![moving image step](https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/gletort/multireg/raw/main/imgs/plugin_movingimg.png)

#### Moving points
You now have to locate where the region of interest (the fixed image) is in your new image and find the landmarks referenced in the fixed image are in this new image. This allows the plugin to put together the region of interest in the two images in a first step, before to fine-tune the registration.

For each point placed in the fixed image, place the corresponding point in the moving image. By default, the moving points are placed close to the fixed points. 
* Each point must have the same label (number) as its corresponding fixed points to associate them correctly. You can change a point label by selecting it and putting the new value in `param` and clicking on `update`.


* When a point is selected, you can drag it to its desired location. To move it in the Z direction, you can press `u` to move it to the next Z (up direction) and `d` (down) to the previous Z. The viewed slice will also move, following the point new position, when you do so.

* You can click on `side_by_side_view` to see the two images (fixed and moving) with their placed points at the same time.

* You can click on `two_windows_view` to see the fixed image and points in a separate Napari window. This allows to have visualize separatly the fixed and moving images and points, and thus to see different z-slices or zoom for each image. The new window will be closed automatically by the plugin if you unselect this option or when you click on `Moving done`.

![two window](https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/gletort/multireg/raw/main/imgs/twowin.png)

When all the moving points have been correctly placed, click on `Save points` to save this positions and let it be usable by the alignement step. The points **have to be saved** in the point file to be correctly loaded in the alignement step.

### Alignement calculation
This step is the core of the plugin. The transformation necessary to change the moving image to match with the fixed image on the `reference chanel` is calculated based on [itk-elastix](https://pypi.org/project/itk-elastix/) python module. It is decomposed in two steps. 

1. First a global **affine registration** is performed, based on the correspondance between the reference and moving points (`do rigid` option). This allows to locate the fixed image postion within the moving image and apply a first **shearing, scaling, rotation and translation** to super-impose the region of interest. 

2. The second step fine-tunes the registration. It doesn't use the reference points (except if rigid transformation was not selected) anymore but calculate the matching based on the images local intensities. **Non-rigid transformation** based on B-spline is performed at this step, thus allowing to compensate for **local deformations** in the moving image (`do bspline` option).

The option `use reference points` determines if the previously placed reference points should be used or if the registration is only based on intensities matching. It's possible to use only the intensities if the two images are not so far away from each other. The reference points will be used only in the first pass (either rigid or bspline) when both are selected. If only one is selected, the points will be used on the selected transformation.

The option `strong_weight_points` allows to give more importance to reference points than to intensities matching when calculating the registration. The weights will be 0.2 for the intensity metric and 0.8 for points metric. Note that if both rigid and bspline transformations are selected, the second transformation (bspline) do not use the points.

![apply alignement step](https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/gletort/multireg/raw/main/imgs/interm.png)


You can click on `show advanced parameters` to tune the parameters of the non rigid transformation. After calculating the registration, the plugin will add a new layer, which is the moving image after alignement, so you can check the sucess of the regristration. `show intermediate_layer` will also add the moving image aligned after the first step only (the points matching with affine registration).

![calculate alignement step](https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/gletort/multireg/raw/main/imgs/align.png)


### Apply alignement
Once the calculated registration is satisfying, you can apply it to all the chanels of your moving image, or only to a few. By default, all chanels are selected in the `Apply alignement` panel, but you can unselect the chanels that you don't want to align in the parameter `align chanels`. 
When you click on `Align images`, the plugin will apply the transformation on the selected chanels of the moving image and save each of them in the `aligned` folder as individual `.tif` files. 

![apply alignement step](https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/gletort/multireg/raw/main/imgs/goalign.png)

### Create resulting image
This step allows to save a single 3D multi-chanels stack with all the aligned chanels. 

The common chanel present in all the images can be averaged together after alignement to obtain a much less noisy image. By default, the aligned `reference chanel` of all the images are averaged together to create the final image first chanel. However, it is possible to unselect some images in the first panel (`average chanels` parameter) if you do not wish to use all the images or do an average.

![create result image](https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/gletort/multireg/raw/main/imgs/create.png)

Then each aligned chanel of all the images that were not the reference chanel are stacked together in the final resulting image. Here also, if you don't want to keep all the other chanels in the resulting image, you can unselect the one that you don't want stacked, in the `add_chanels` parameter. 
All the aligned chanels have been previously saved in the `aligned` folder. If `delete_files` is checked (default) all these interemediate files will be deleted and only the final resulting stack will be saved in that folder.

You will end-up with a final 3D multi-chanels stack, saved as a `.tif` file in the `aligned` folder, with the same name as your fixed image. It can have a lot of chanels if you stacked together multiple images.
In napari, you can separate the chanels by right clicking on the layer and select `Split stack`. 
In Fiji, you can make the stack as a composite to see the chanels with different colors.

## Overview

Deep learning methods for motion tracking have revolutionised a range of
scientific disciplines, from neuroscience and biomechanics, to conservation
and ethology. Tools such as
[DeepLabCut](https://www.mackenziemathislab.org/deeplabcut) and
[SLEAP](https://sleap.ai/) now allow researchers to track animal movements
in videos with remarkable accuracy, without requiring physical markers.
However, there is still a need for standardised, easy-to-use methods
to process the tracks generated by these tools.

`movement` aims to provide a consistent, modular interface for analysing
motion tracks, enabling steps such as data cleaning, visualisation,
and motion quantification. We aim to support all popular animal tracking
frameworks and file formats.

Temporal registration of 2D/3D movies on one channel based on [itk-elastix](https://pypi.org/project/itk-elastix/), and transpose alignement to the other channels.

Adaptated from [multireg](https://gitlab.pasteur.fr/gletort/multireg) for temporal movies.
For a tutorial on using `elastix` for registration, see [this tutorial](https://m-albert.github.io/elastix_tutorial/intro.html).


----------------------------------
## Installation

* You can install the plugin directly in `Napari` by going to `Plugins>Install/Uninstall plugins` and search for `napari-3dtimereg`

* Or you can install `napari-3dtimereg` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-3dtimereg


## Usage

You can launch `3dtimereg` in napari by going to `Plugins>Do 3D movie registration (napari-3dtimereg)`.

### Choose movie and reference chanel

First, choose select the movie that you want to register. The plugin will create a folder `aligned` in the folder of your selected movie where the results will be saved.

Choose the color chanel on which to calculate the registration (`reference chanel`). Color chanels are numbered from 0 to nchanels, and you can see their respective number in the layer list on the left panel of Napari. Click on `Update` when the correct chanel is selected to go to the registration calculation step.

### Calculate temporal alignement

The registration is calculated iteratively from one frame to another. Thus the first frame is not moved and all the other frames are aligned to it.
You can tune several parameters in this plugin:

![parameters screenshot](./imgs/parameters.png ""Registration parameters"")

The other parameters are parameters to use [itk-elastix](https://elastix.lumc.nl/) to calculate the registration.
* `show log`: to see the log of Elastix calculation
* `do rigid`: performs a rigid (affine) transformation step, that allowed to correct for translations/rotations.
* `do bspline`: performs a b-spline based transformation step, that allowed for local deformations in the image.
* `show advanced parameters`: to control the parameters used in the rigid and/or bspline transformations. These parameters control the size of the local registrations calculated, the resolutions at which the transformations are calculated, and can thus greatly impact the results.
* `final order`: is the final order of the B-Splines used for the registration. 
* `resolution`: is the number of consecutives resolutions at which the registration will be made. First the registration is made at the lowest level of resolution, correcting global deformations/motions, then at each step, the registration is done on higher resolution, allowing to correct for more local deformations.
* `final spacing`: is the physical spacing of the smallest resolution.
* `iterations`: are the maximum number of iterations allowed to minimize the distance between the two images for each resolution and type of registration.

If both rigid and bspline transformations, the program first applies the rigid transformation to allow for a global registration of the images. Then it will performs the second step of b-spline transformation that can includes local deformations.

For each frame, after calculating the registration on the reference chanel, the plugin will apply the calculated transformation to all the other color chanels of the initial movie. All results are saved as separated images in the `aligned` folder during the computation.

### Create the final aligned movie

When all frames have been processed, each color chanel and each frame have been saved in the `aligned` folder as separated images. This is usefull to calculate the registration on large movies without having to keep all the intermediates and calculated images in memory. You can directly use these separated images, or reconstruct a single composite movie of the result.

If you click on `Concatenate aligned images` on the plugin interface, the plugin will create a single composite movie from the aligned images, save it and delete the separated images in the `aligned` folder.

A [Napari](https://napari.org/) plugin to read in Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) files using
[AFMReader](https://github.com/AFM-SPM/AFMReader.git).

You can drag and drop your favourite AFM image files directly into the Napari viewer to use the awesome tools the image
analysis community have developed over at the [Napari Hub](https://www.napari-hub.org/) to analyse your images using
open-source software and a GUI!

| File Extension | Supported by AFMReader | Description              |

| `.topostats`   | ✅                     | topostats output format. |

## Installation

### Via Napari-Hub

This software should be installable directly from Napari!

All you need to do is:

1. [Install Napari](https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/fundamentals/installation.html) into an environment.
2. Open Napari by typing `napari` into your command line with your Napari environment activated.

   ```bash
   napari
   ```

3. Go to `Plugins` > `Install/Uninstall Plugins`, and search for `napari-afmreader`.

### Via Git

Occasionally the Napari-Hub version of `napari-AFMReader` may not be the most up-to-date. This is when you might want
to install both the most up-to-date `AFMReader` and `napari-AFMReader` versions via Git.

`napari-AFMReader` has been designed to need minimal maintenance, with most of the new file type additions being solely
added to AFMReader.

1. With [Git installed](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) on your machine, clone both the
   `AFMReader` and `napari-AFMReader` repositories:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AFM-SPM/AFMReader.git
   ```

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AFM-SPM/napari-AFMReader.git
   ```

2. Activate your Python environment (e.g. Conda) and install the dependencies for each - make sure that the `AFMReader`
   dependency is installed second to overwrite the possibly outdated `afmreader` package!

   ```bash
   cd napari-AFMReader
   pip install .
   cd ..
   ```

   ```bash
   cd AFMReader
   pip install .
   ```

3. Now when you open Napari via the `napari` command, it should use the latest version of `AFMReader`, and
   `napari-AFMReader`.

   ```bash
   napari
   ```

## Usage

This package should be fairly straight-forward and intuitive to use, requiring you to:

1. Drag and drop your supported AFM file into the Napari Viewer.

2. Type in the name of the channel you would like to use. You may not need to specify a channel for e.g. `.stp`, or the
   channel may refer to image key in the `.napari-afmreader` file.\*.

   \*_Possible channel names will not appear at first due to the order in which AFMReader processes an image. Thus,
   when provided with an non-existent channel name, the dialogue box will then return a list of possible channels to
   choose from._

##  Auxiliary plugins
### Reconstruct Selected
One use case of Napari 3D Counter is to visualize a subset of labeled cells.
For example, automated process label your cells of interest as well as a set of
off-target cells, and you would like to visualize only your cells of interest.
This can be accomplished by using Napari 3D Counter to count your cells of
interest, and some other process to create labels (perhaps
[nsbatwm](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-segment-blobs-and-things-with-membranes))
and using Reconstruct Selected to create a new image layer of those labels
which have been counted as a particular cell type.

### Ingress Points
This plugin takes a points layer and adds the points to the selected cell_type
layer. This can be usefull if you want to manualy count cells after cell identification.

## Usage

### Object and Semantic Segmentation

Starting point is napari with at least one image layer and one labels layer (your annotation).

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification/raw/main/images/object_segmentation_starting_point.png)

You find Object and Semantic Segmentation in the `Tools > Segmentation / labeling`. When starting those, the following graphical user interface will show up.

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification/raw/main/images/object_and_semantic_segmentation.png)

1. Choose one or multiple images to train on. These images will be considered as multiple channels. Thus, they need to be spatially correlated. 
   Training from multiple images showing different scenes is not (yet) supported from the graphical user interface. Check out [this notebook](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/apoc/blob/main/demo/demp_pixel_classifier_continue_training.ipynb) if you want to train from multiple image-annotation pairs.
2. Select a file where the classifier should be saved. If the file exists already, it will be overwritten.
3. Select the ground-truth annotation labels layer. 
4. Select which label corresponds to foreground (not available in Semantic Segmentation)
5. Select the feature images that should be considered for segmentation. If segmentation appears pixelated, try increasing the selected sigma values and untick `Consider original image`.
6. Tree depth and number of trees allow you to fine-tune how to deal with manifold regions of different characteristics. The higher these numbers, the longer segmentation will take. In case you use many images and many features, high depth and number of trees might be necessary. (See also `max_depth` and `n_estimators` in the [scikit-learn documentation of the Random Forest Classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html).
7. The estimation of memory consumption allows you to tune the configuration to your GPU-hardware. Also consider the GPU-hardware of others who want to use your classifier.
8. Click on Run when you're done with configuring. If the segmentation doesn't fit after the first execution, consider fine-tuning the ground-truth annotation and try again.

A successful segmentation can for example look like this:

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification/raw/main/images/object_segmentation_result.png)

After your classifier has been trained successfully, click on the ""Application / Prediction"" tab. If you apply the classifier again, python code will be generated. 
You can use this code for example to apply the same classifier to a folder of images. If you're new to this, check out [this notebook](https://github.com/BiAPoL/Bio-image_Analysis_with_Python/blob/main/image_processing/12_process_folders.ipynb).

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification/raw/main/images/code_generation.png)

A pre-trained classifier can be [applied from scripts as shown in the example notebook](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/apoc/blob/main/demo/demo_object_segmenter.ipynb) or from the `Tools > Segmentation / labeling > Object segmentation (apply pretrained, APOC)`.

### Integration with the napari-assistant

Pre-trained models can also be assembled to workflows using the [napari-assistant](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-assistant). You find APOC-operations in the categories `Filter`, `Label` and `Label Filters`:

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification/raw/main/images/assistant.png)

### Semantic segmentation

Users can also generate semantic segmentation label images where the label identifier corresponds to a class the pixel has been allocated to. 
The tool can be found in the menu `Tools > Segmentation / labeling > Semantic segmentation (APOC)`.
It works analogously like the Object Segmenter, just without the need to specify the class identifier that objects correspond to.

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification/raw/main/images/semantic_segmentation.png)

### Probability maps

The tool for generating probability maps (`Tools > Filtering > Probability Mapper (APOC)` menu) works analogously to the Object Segmenter as well. 
The only difference is that the result image is not a label image but an intensity image where the intensity represents the probability (between 0 and 1)
that a pixel belongs to a given class. In this example: The raw image (grey) has been annotated with three classes: background (black, label 1), foreground (white, label 2) and edges (grey, label 3).
The probability mapper was configured to create probability image (shown in green) for edges (label 3):

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification/raw/main/images/probability_mapper.png)

### Classifier statistics

While training, you can also activate the `Show classifier statistics` checkbox. 
When doing so, it is recommended to increase the number of trees so that the measurements are more reliable, especially when selecting many features.
This will open a small table after training where you can see how large the share of decision trees are for each analysed feature image.

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification/raw/main/images/classifier_statistics.png)

It is recommended to turn on/off the features that hold a very large share (green) or a very small share (magenta) of trees in the random forest. 
Retrain the classifier to see how the features influence the decision making.

Note: Multiple of these parameters may be correlated. 
If you select 11 feature images, which all allow to make the pixel classification similarly, but 10 of those are correlated, these 10 may appear with a share of about 0.05 while the 11th parameter has a share of 0.5. 
Thus, study these values with care.

### Merging objects

After segmentation, you can merge labeled objects using the `Tools > Segmentation post-processing > Merge objects (APOC)` menu. 
Annotate label edges that should be merged with intensity 1 and those which should be kept with intensity 2 in a blank label image.
Select which features should be considered for merging:
* `touch_portion`: The relative amount an object touches another. E.g. in a symmetric, honey-comb like tissue, neighboring cells have a touch-portion of `1/6` to each other.
* `touch_count`: The number of pixels where object touch. When using this parameter, make sure that images used for training and prediction have the same voxel size.
* `mean_touch_intensity`: The mean average intensity between touching objects. When using this parameter, make sure images used for training and prediction are normalized the same way.
* `centroid_distance`: The distance (in pixels or voxels) between centroids of labeled objects. 
* `mean_intensity_difference`: The absolute difference between the mean intensity of the two objects. This measurement allows differentiating bright and dark object and [not] merging them.
* `standard_deviation_intensity_difference`: The absolute difference between the standard deviation of the two objects. This measurement allows to differentiate [in]homogeneous objects and [not] merge them.
* `area_difference`: The difference in area/volume/pixel-count allows differentiating small and large objects and [not] merging them.
* `mean_max_distance_to_centroid_ratio_difference`: This parameter is a shape descriptor, similar to elongation, allowing to differentiate roundish and elongate object and [not] merging them.

Note: most features are recommended to be used in isotropic images only.

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification/raw/main/images/merge_objects.gif)

For training, use an image with equivalized intensity (1), an over-segmented label image (2) and annotations (3). When drawing annotations in a new labels layer, make sure to misguide the algorithm draw on edges of touching objects a 1 if those should be merged and a 2 if they should be kept. Make sure there are no 1/2 annotation circles on both: labels which should be merged and kept.

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification/raw/main/images/merge_objects2.png)

### Object classification

Click the menu `Tools > Segmentation post-processing > Object classification (APOC)`. 

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification/raw/main/images/menu.png)

This user interface will be shown:

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification/raw/main/images/object_classifier_gui.png)

1. The image layer will be used for intensity based feature extraction (see below).
2. The labels layer should be contain the segmentation of objects that should be classified. 
   You can use the Object Segmenter explained above to create this layer.
3. The annotation layer should contain manual annotations of object classes. 
   You can draw lines crossing single and multiple objects of the same kind. 
   For example draw a line through some elongated objects with label ""1"" and another line through some rather roundish objects with label ""2"".
   If these lines touch the background, that will be ignored.
4. Tree depth and number of trees allow you to fine-tune how to deal with manifold objects of different characteristics. The higher these numbers, the longer classification will take. In case you use many features, high depth and number of trees might be necessary. (See also `max_depth` and `n_estimators` in the [scikit-learn documentation of the Random Forest Classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html).
5. Select the right features for training. For example, for differentiating objects according to their shape as suggested above, select ""shape"".
   The features are extracted using clEsperanto and are shown by example in [this notebook](https://github.com/clEsperanto/pyclesperanto_prototype/blob/master/demo/tissues/parametric_maps.ipynb).
6. Click on the `Run` button. If classification doesn't perform well in the first attempt, try changing selected features.  

If classification worked well, it may for example look like this. Note the two thick lines which were drawn to annotate elongated and roundish objects with brown and cyan:

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification/raw/main/images/object_classification_result.png)

A pre-trained model can later be applied [from scripts as shown in the example notebook](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/apoc/blob/main/demo/cell_classification.ipynb) or using the menu `Tools > Segmentation post-processing > Object classification (apply pretrained, APOC)`.

### Object selection

Analogously to object classification, the object selector removes all objects from a label image that do not belong to a specified class.
It can be found in the menu `Tools > Segmentation post-processing > Object selection (APOC)`. 

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification/raw/main/images/select_objects.gif)


### Feature correlation matrix

When training object classifiers it is crucial to investigate to which degree features are correlated and select the right, ideally uncorrelated features to classify objects robustly.
After measuring features with any compatible napari plugin listed below, you can visualize the feature correlation matrix using the menu `Tools > Measurement tables > Show feature correlation matrix (pandas, APOC)` and by selecting the labels layer which has been analyzed.
Before computing the correlation matrix, all rows containing [NaN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN) values are removed.
For further details, please refer to the [documentation of the underlying function in pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.corr.html).

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification/raw/main/images/feature_correlation_matrix.png)

### Surface Vertex Classification (SVeC)

When using napari-APOC in combination with [napari-process-points-and-surfaces>=0.3.3](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-process-points-and-surfaces), 
one can also classify vertices. Therefore, use for example the menu `Measurement > Surface quality table (vedo, nppas)` to determine quantitative measurements
and the menu `Surfaces > Annotate surface manually (nppas)` for manual annotations. It is recommended to annotate the entire surface with value 1 as background, and specific regions of interest with integer numbers > 1.
After measurements have been extracted and annotations were made, start SVeC from the `Surfaces > Surface vertex classification (custom properties, APOC)` menu. It can be used like the Object Classifier explained above.

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification/raw/main/images/demo_vertex_classification.gif)

[Download full video](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification/raw/main/images/demo_vertex_classification.mp4)

### Classifier statistics
After classifier training, you can study the share of the individual features/measurements and how they are correlated by activating the checkboxes `Show classifier statistics` and `Show feature correlation matrix`.

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification/raw/main/images/correlation_matrix2.png)

This can help understanding how the classifier works. Furthermore, you can accelerate the classifier by reducing the number of correlated features.

### Object classification from custom measurements

You can also classify labeled objects according to custom measurements. For deriving those measurements, you can use these napari plugins:

* [morphometrics](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/morphometrics)
* [PartSeg](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/PartSeg)
* [napari-simpleitk-image-processing](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-simpleitk-image-processing)
* [napari-cupy-image-processing](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-cupy-image-processing)
* [napari-pyclesperanto-assistant](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-pyclesperanto-assistant)
* [napari-skimage-regionprops](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-skimage-regionprops)

Furthermore, if you use napari from Python, you can also create a dictionary or pandas DataFrame with measurements and store it in the `labels_layer.features` to make them available in the object classifier.

After labels have been measured, you can start the `Object Classifier (custom properties, APOC)` from the `Tools > Segmentation post-processing` menu:

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification/raw/main/images/table_row_classifier_gui.png)

1. Select the labels layers that has been measured.
2. The annotation layer should contain manual annotations of object classes. 
   You can draw lines crossing single and multiple objects of the same kind. 
   For example draw a line through some elongated objects with label ""1"" and another line through some rather roundish objects with label ""2"".
   If these lines touch the background, that will be ignored.
3. Select the measurements / features that should be used for object classification.
4. Use the `Update Measurements` button in case you did new measurements after Object classifier dialog was opened.
5. Enter the filename of the classifier to be trained here. This file will be overwritten in case it existed already.
6. Tree depth and number of trees allow you to fine-tune how to deal with manifold objects of different characteristics. The higher these numbers, the longer classification will take. In case you use many features, high depth and number of trees might be necessary. (See also `max_depth` and `n_estimators` in the [scikit-learn documentation of the Random Forest Classifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html).
7. The classification result will be stored under this name in the labels-layer's properties.
8. Choose if the results table should be shown. Choose if classifier statistics should be shown. [Read more about classifier statistics](https://haesleinhuepf.github.io/BioImageAnalysisNotebooks/27_cell_classification/forest_statistics.html).
9. Click on `Run` to start training and prediction.

You can also train those classifiers from Python and reuse them: [Read more about using the TableRowClassifier from python](https://haesleinhuepf.github.io/BioImageAnalysisNotebooks/27_cell_classification/apoc_simpleitk_object_classification.html)

### Classifier statistics and correlation matrix
After classifier training, you can study the share of the individual features/measurements and how they are correlated by activating the checkboxes `Show classifier statistics` and `Show correlation matrix`.
![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification/raw/main/images/correlation_matrix.png)

This can help understanding how the classifier works. Furthermore, you can accelerate the classifier by reducing the number of correlated features.

## Installation

You will need a conda environment for everything to run
smoothly. Supported python versions are 3.7, 3.8, 3.9.

### pip
You can install `napari-affinities` via [pip]:

    `pip install napari-affinities`

To install latest development version :

    `pip install git+https://github.com/pattonw/napari-affinities.git`

Install torch according to your system [(follow the instructions here)](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). For example with cuda 10.2 available, run:

    conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch

Install conda requirements:

    conda install -c conda-forge affogato

### conda

If you install via conda, there are fewer steps since
affogato and pytorch will be installed for you.

You can install `napari-affinities` via [conda]:

    `conda install -c conda-forge napari-affinities`

### Download example model:

#### 2D:

[epithelial example model](https://oc.embl.de/index.php/s/zfWMKu7HoQnSJLs)
Place the model zip file wherever you want. You can open it in the plugin with the ""load from file"" button.

#### 3D

[lightsheet example model](https://owncloud.gwdg.de/index.php/s/LsShICsOcilqPRs)
Unpack the tar file into test data (`lightsheet_nuclei_test_data` (an hdf5 file)) and model (`LightsheetNucleusSegmentation.zip` (a bioimageio model)).
Move the data into sample_data which will enable you to load the ""Lightsheet Sample"" data in napari.
Place the model zip file anywhere you want. You can open it in the plugin with the ""load from file"" button.

##### Workarounds to be fixed:

1. you need to update the `rdf.yaml` in the `LightsheetNucleusSegmentation.zip` with the following:
   - ""shape"" for ""input0"" should be updated with a larger minimum input size and ""output0"" should be updated with a larger halo. If not fixed, there will be significant tiling artifacts.
   - (Optional) ""output0"" should be renamed to affinities. The plugin supports multiple outputs and relies on names for figuring out which one is which. If unrecognized names are provided we assume the outputs are ordered (affinities, fgbg, lsds) but this is less reliable than explicit names.
2. This model also generates foreground in the same array as affinities, i.e. a 10 channel output `(fgbg, [-1, 0, 0], [0, -1, 0], [0, 0, -1], [-2, 0, 0], ...)`. Although predictions will work, post processing such as mutex watershed will break unless you manually separate the first channel.

## Use

Requirements for the model:

1. Bioimageio packaged pytorch model
2. Outputs with names ""affinities"", ""fgbg""(optional) or ""lsds""(optional)
   - if these names are not used, it will be assumed that the outputs are affinities, fgbg, then lsds in that order

        -   `AVI`
        -   [Full List](https://imageio.readthedocs.io/en/v2.4.1/formats.html)

_While upstream `aicsimageio` is released under BSD-3 license, this plugin is released under GPLv3 license because it installs all format reader dependencies._

## Installation

**Stable Release:** `pip install napari-aicsimageio` or `conda install napari-aicsimageio -c conda-forge`<br>
**Development Head:** `pip install git+https://github.com/AllenCellModeling/napari-aicsimageio.git`

### Reading Mode Threshold

This image reading plugin will load the provided image directly into memory if it meets
the following two conditions:

1. The filesize is less than 4GB.
2. The filesize is less than 30% of machine memory available.

If either of these conditions isn't met, the image is loaded in chunks only as needed.

### Use napari-aicsimageio as the Reader for All File Formats

If you want to force napari to always use this plugin as the reader for all file formats,
try running this snippet:

```python
from napari.settings import get_settings

get_settings().plugins.extension2reader = {'*': 'napari-aicsimageio', **get_settings().plugins.extension2reader}
```

For more details, see [#37](https://github.com/AllenCellModeling/napari-aicsimageio/issues/37).

## Examples of Features

#### General Image Reading

All image file formats supported by
[aicsimageio](https://github.com/AllenCellModeling/aicsimageio) will be read and all
raw data will be available in the napari viewer.

In addition, when reading an OME-TIFF, you can view all OME metadata directly in the
napari viewer thanks to `ome-types`.

![screenshot of an OME-TIFF image view, multi-channel, z-stack, with metadata viewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllenCellModeling/napari-aicsimageio/main/images/ome-tiff-with-metadata-viewer.png)

#### Multi-Scene Selection

When reading a multi-scene file, a widget will be added to the napari viewer to manage
scene selection (clearing the viewer each time you change scene or adding the
scene content to the viewer) and a list of all scenes in the file.

![gif of drag and drop file to scene selection and management](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllenCellModeling/napari-aicsimageio/main/images/scene-selection.gif)

#### Access to the AICSImage Object and Metadata

![napari viewer with console open showing `viewer.layers[0].metadata`](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllenCellModeling/napari-aicsimageio/main/images/console-access.png)

You can access the `AICSImage` object used to load the image pixel data and
image metadata using the built-in napari console:

```python
img = viewer.layers[0].metadata[""aicsimage""]
img.dims.order  # TCZYX
img.channel_names  # [""Bright"", ""Struct"", ""Nuc"", ""Memb""]
img.get_image_dask_data(""ZYX"")  # dask.array.Array
```

The napari layer metadata dictionary also stores a shorthand
for the raw image metadata:

```python
viewer.layers[0].metadata[""raw_image_metadata""]
```

The metadata is returned in whichever format is used by the underlying
file format reader, i.e. for CZI the raw metadata is returned as
an `xml.etree.ElementTree.Element`, for OME-TIFF the raw metadata is returned
as an `OME` object from `ome-types`.

Lastly, if the underlying file format reader has an OME metadata conversion function,
you may additionally see a key in the napari layer metadata dictionary
called `""ome_types""`. For example, because the AICSImageIO
`CZIReader` and `BioformatsReader` both support converting raw image metadata
to OME metadata, you will see an `""ome_types""` key that stores the metadata transformed
into the OME metadata model.

```python
viewer.layers[0].metadata[""ome_types""]  # OME object from ome-types
```

#### Mosaic Reading

When reading CZI or LIF images, if the image is a mosaic tiled image, `napari-aicsimageio`
will return the reconstructed image:

![screenshot of a reconstructed / restitched mosaic tile LIF](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AllenCellModeling/napari-aicsimageio/main/images/tiled-lif.png)

## Development

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for information related to developing the code.

For additional file format support, contributed directly to
[AICSImageIO](https://github.com/AllenCellModeling/aicsimageio).
New file format support will become directly available in this
plugin on new `aicsimageio` releases.

A plugin that enables image annotation/scoring and writes annotations to a .csv file. 
Plugin provided by the Allen Institute for Cell Science.

The Allen Cell Image Annotator plugin for napari provides an intuitive
graphical user interface to create annotation templates, annotate large 
image sets using these templates, and save image annotations to a csv file. 
The Allen Cell Image Annotator is a Python-based open source toolkit 
developed at the Allen Institute for Cell Science for both blind, unbiased and un-blind 
microscope image annotating. This toolkit supports easy image set selection
from a file finder and creation of annotation templates (text, checkbox, drop-down, spinbox, and point).
With napari's multi-dimensional image viewing capabilities, the plugin seamlessly allows users to
view each image and write annotations into the custom template.
Annotation templates can be written to a json file for sharing or re-using. After annotating,
the annotation template, image file list, and the annotation values 
are conveniently saved to csv file, which can be re-opened for further annotating. 

-   Supports the following image types:
    - `OME-TIFF`
    - `TIFF`
    - `CZI` 
    - `PNG` 
    - `JPEG`
    - `OME-ZARR`

A plugin that enables 3D image segmentation provided by Allen Institute for Cell Science

The Allen Cell & Structure Segmenter plugin for napari provides an intuitive graphical user interface to access the powerful segmentation capabilities of an open source 3D segmentation software package developed and maintained by the Allen Institute for Cell Science (classic workflows only with v1.0). ​[The Allen Cell & Structure Segmenter](https://allencell.org/segmenter) is a Python-based open source toolkit developed at the Allen Institute for Cell Science for 3D segmentation of intracellular structures in fluorescence microscope images. This toolkit brings together classic image segmentation and iterative deep learning workflows first to generate initial high-quality 3D intracellular structure segmentations and then to easily curate these results to generate the ground truths for building robust and accurate deep learning models. The toolkit takes advantage of the high replicate 3D live cell image data collected at the Allen Institute for Cell Science of over 30 endogenous fluorescently tagged human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines. Each cell line represents a different intracellular structure with one or more distinct localization patterns within undifferentiated hiPS cells and hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes.

More details about Segmenter can be found at https://allencell.org/segmenter

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using with [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/docs/plugins/index.html
-->

## Installation

### Option 1 (recommended):

After you installed the lastest version of napari, you can go to ""Plugins"" --> ""Install/Uninstall Package(s)"". Then, you will be able to see all available napari plugins and you can find us by name `napari-allencell-segmenter`. Just click the ""install"" button to install the Segmenter plugin.

### Option 2:

You can also install `napari-allencell-segmenter` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-allencell-segmenter

## Quick Start

In the current version, there are two parts in the plugin: **workflow editor** and **batch processing**. The **workflow editor** allows users adjusting parameters in all the existing workflows in the lookup table, so that the workflow can be optimized on users' data. The adjusted workflow can be saved and then applied to a large batch of files using the **batch processing** part of the plugin. 

1. Open a file in napari (the plugin is able to support multi-dimensional data in .tiff, .tif. ome.tif, .ome.tiff, .czi)
2. Start the plugin (open napari, go to ""Plugins"" --> ""napari-allencell-segmenter"" --> ""workflow editor"")
3. Select the image and channel to work on
4. Select a workflow based on the example image and target segmentation based on user's data. Ideally, it is recommend to start with the example with very similar morphology as user's data.
5. Click ""Run All"" to execute the whole workflow on the sample data.
6. Adjust the parameters of steps, based on the intermediate results. For instruction on the details on each function and the effect of each parameter, click the tooltip button. A complete list of all functions can be found [here](https://github.com/AllenCell/aics-segmentation/blob/main/aicssegmentation/structure_wrapper_config/function_params.md)
7. Click ""Run All"" again after adjusting the parameters and repeat step 6 and 7 until the result is satisfactory.
8. Save the workflow
9. Close the plugin and open the **batch processing** part by (go to ""Plugins"" --> ""napari-allencell-segmenter"" --> ""batch processing"")
10. Load the customized workflow (or an off-the-shelf workflow) json file
11. Load the folder with all the images to process
12. Click ""Run""

----------------------------------

### Input data structure

Napari-amdtrk reads an input directory which includes:
- An intensity image (`tif`) in txyc (or txy) format
- An object mask (`tif`) in txy format
- An object table (`csv`) with following essential columns:
    - frame: time frame
    - trackId: ID of the track, starting from 1
    - Center_of_the_object_0: x coordinate
    - Center_of_the_object_1: y coordinate
    - continuous_label: the corresponding label (intensity value) of the object in the object mask (You may use `skimage.measure.label` to get it from a binary mask).

- A config file named `config.yaml` (_other names are not allowed_)

    Within the config file, there should be:
    - intensity_suffix: suffix of the intensity image (e.g., for `foo_GFP.tif`, use `GFP` in the config). For multiple intensity images, separate them with commas (e.g., `GFP, mCherry`)
    - mask_suffix: suffix of the mask image
    - track_suffix: suffix of the tracked object table
    - frame_base: index of the first frame (either `0` or `1`)
    - stateCol: __optional__ column name for the cell state (e.g., cell cycle phase) in the object table. Leave blank if the object table does not contain it

__Napari-amdtrk will modify mask and track files in place.__ Other files are not affected.

---
### Quick start

1. Open `napari` GUI.
2. `File` > `Open folder` > choose `Amend segmentation and track`
3. `Plugins` > `napari-amdtrk: Amend track widget` > `Run`
4. In `layer list`, select the `segm` layer to start editing.

Please check out the demo video [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oHPdYcKv-QgOWylm21DnOF1NlVNsRIcL/view) and the sample data (see below).

----------------------------------

### Sample data

To load sample data, `File` > `Open Sample` > `napari-amdtrk` > `basic tracks` or `complete cell cycle tracks`.

- basic tracks: simple cell tracks as essential input data.
- complete cell cycle tracks: cell tracks with additional cell cycle features.

The above operations will download data to `~/.amd_trk/_sample_data/` (__~230MB__). After downloading is finished, sample data will be loaded.

_Notes_
- Please cite this repository if using the plugin in your work (try `About` > `Cite this repository` upper right of this homepage).
  
- Sample data (cell track videos) have been published with [_pcnaDeep: a fast and robust single-cell tracking method using deep-learning mediated cell cycle profiling_](10.1093/bioinformatics/btac602). We acknowledge Dr Kuan Yoow Chan and members of his lab for generating the data.

**napari-animation** is a plugin for making animations in [napari](https://napari.org).

<p align=""center"">
  <img width=""500"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7307488/196110138-6c4663b1-67b2-4c79-97b7-57b706d1d49c.gif"">
</p>

----------------------------------

[Merlin Lange](https://twitter.com/Merlin_Lange) used *napari-animation* to create one of [Nature's best science images for September 2022](https://www.nature.com/immersive/d41586-022-03051-6/index.html)

----------------------------------

This plugin is built on [`naparimovie`](https://github.com/guiwitz/naparimovie) from [@guiwitz](https://github.com/guiwitz). `naparimovie` was submitted to napari in [PR#851](https://github.com/napari/napari/pull/780) before napari plugin infrastructure existed.

----------------------------------

## Overview

**napari-animation** provides a framework for the creation of animations in napari. The plugin contains:

- an easy to use GUI for creating animations interactively;
- a Python package for the programmatic creation of animations.

This plugin remains under development and contributions are very welcome, please open an issue to discuss potential improvements.

You can read the documentation at [https://napari.org/napari-animation](https://napari.org/napari-animation)

## Installation

### PyPI
`napari-animation` is available through the Python package index and can be installed using `pip`.

```sh
pip install napari-animation
```

```{warning}
`napari-animation` uses `ffmpeg` to export animations. If you are using a macOS arm64 computer (Apple Silicon e.g. M1, M2 processor)
the PyPI package does not include the needed binary for your platform. You will need to install `ffmpeg` using
`conda` from the [conda-forge channel](https://conda-forge.org/docs/#what-is-conda-forge) (`conda install -c conda-forge ffmpeg`)
or using [`homebrew`](https://brew.sh) (`brew install ffmpeg`).
```

### Conda
`napari-animation` is also available for install using `conda` through the [conda-forge channel](https://conda-forge.org/docs/#what-is-conda-forge).

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge napari-animation
```

### Local
You can clone this repository and install locally with

    pip install -e .

### Interactive use
**napari-animation** can be used interactively.

An animation is created by capturing [keyframes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_frame) containing the current viewer state.

<p align=""center"">
  <img width=""600"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7307488/196113682-96ce0da3-fa5c-411e-8fb1-52dc3a8f96b6.png"">
</p>

To activate the GUI, select **napari-animation: wizard** from the *plugins menu*

<p align=""center"">
  <img width=""200"" src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7307488/196114466-56cb5985-0d79-4cfa-96f1-38cf3ccfbc48.png"">
</p>

### Scripting

**napari-animation** can also be run programatically, allowing for reproducible, scripted creation of animations.

```python
from napari_animation import Animation

animation = Animation(viewer)

viewer.dims.ndisplay = 3
viewer.camera.angles = (0.0, 0.0, 90.0)
animation.capture_keyframe()
viewer.camera.zoom = 2.4
animation.capture_keyframe()
viewer.camera.angles = (-7.0, 15.7, 62.4)
animation.capture_keyframe(steps=60)
viewer.camera.angles = (2.0, -24.4, -36.7)
animation.capture_keyframe(steps=60)
viewer.reset_view()
viewer.camera.angles = (0.0, 0.0, 90.0)
animation.capture_keyframe()
animation.animate('demo.mov', canvas_only=False)
```

## Examples

Examples can be found in our [Examples gallery](https://napari.org/napari-animation/gallery), generated from [our example scripts](https://github.com/napari/napari-animation/tree/main/examples). Simple examples for both interactive and headless
use of the plugin follow.

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome and a detailed contributing guide is coming soon.
In the meantime, clone this repository and install it in editable mode using `pip`:

```
pip install -e .
```
We recommend using a virtual environment, for example `conda`.


```{important}
Ensure you have a suitable Qt backend for napari! We recommend `PyQt5`.
For more information, see the napari [Qt backend installation guide](https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/fundamentals/installation.html#choosing-a-different-qt-backend)
```

To set up your development installation, clone this repository, navigate to the clone folder, and install napari-animation in editable mode using `pip`.

```sh
conda create -n nap-anim python=3.10
conda activate nap-anim
pip install -e "".[dev]"" PyQt5

```

Tests are run with `pytest`.
You can make sure your `[dev]` installation is working properly by running
`pytest .` from within the repository.

```{note}
We use [`pre-commit`](https://pre-commit.com) to sort imports and lint with
[`ruff`](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) and format code with
[`black`](https://github.com/psf/black) automatically prior to each commit.
To minmize test errors when submitting pull requests, please install `pre-commit`
in your environment as follows:

`pre-commit install`
```

## Documentation

The documentation is available at [https://napari.org/napari-animation](https://napari.org/napari-animation)

The documentation for napari-animation is built with [Sphinx](https://www.spinx-doc.org) and the [napari Sphinx Theme](https://github.com/napari/napari-sphinx-theme).

### Building docs locally

After installing the documentation dependencies with

```sh
pip install "".[doc]""
```

you can see a local version of the documentation by running

```sh
make docs
```

Open up the `docs/_build/index.html` file in your browser, and you'll see the home page of the docs being displayed.

### Deploying docs

The napari-animation documentation is automatically built and deployed to the website
whenever the main branch is updated, or a new release is tagged.
This is controlled by the [deploy_docs.yml](https://github.com/napari/napari-animation/blob/main/.github/workflows/deploy_docs.yml) github actions script.

You can also manually trigger a documenation re-build and deployment [from the github actions tab](https://github.com/napari/napari-animation/actions/workflows/deploy_docs.yml).

This napari plugin allows to define projects consisting of multiple images that can be annotated with labels and rectangular regions of interest (rois). Those rois can then be exported as series of cropped images and labels, typically to train Machine Learning models. Projects can be easily reopened in order to browse through images and their annotations. This package is a meant to be a *light-weight plugin which does not introduce any specific dependencies* and that should be easily installable in any environment already containing napari and other plugins.

## Usage
To start a project, you can just drag and drop files in the file list area. This prompts for the selection of a project folder. After that, more files (also from different folders) can be dragged and dropped to be included in the project. Files can optionally be copied to the project folder but this option has to be set **before adding files**. When selecting a file in the list, it is opened (using the default image reader or a reader plugin if installed) and two layers, one for rois, and one for annotations are added.

### Adding rois
After selecting the ```rois``` layer, you can add rectangular rois to the image. If you need square rois of a specific size (as often needed in DL training) you can select the ```Fixed roi size``` option and then use the ```Add roi``` button. **Note that currently only 2D rois are supported**. If you work with nD images, the roi is therefore added to the **current selected 2D plane**.

### Adding annotations
After selecting the ```annotations``` layer, you can add annotations to your image. There are no restrictions here and you can e.g. add as many labels as you need.

### Info storage
All relevant information on project location, project files and rois is stored in a yaml file ```Parameters.yml```. Annotations are stored as 2D tiff files in the ```annotations``` as files named after the original files. **Note that at the moment if multiple files have the same name, this will cause trouble**. This parameter file is used when re-loading an existing project.

## Exporting rois
Once you are satisfied with your annotations and rois, you can use the rois to export only the corresponing cropped rois of both the image and annotation layers. For this you can head to the ```Export``` tab. Here you can set the location of the export folder, set the names of the folders that will contain cropped images and cropped annotations, and finally set the prefix names for these two types of files. Files are exported as tif files.

A lightweight plugin extending label layer control.

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [copier] using the [napari-plugin-template].

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/napari-plugin-template#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/stable/plugins/index.html
-->
## Description
This lightweight plugin helps you navigate your labels layer. It is intended to ease your manual annotation work.
![Overview image](resources/image1.png)
- Select a label from the list.
- Toggle the visibility of individual label entries.
- Move to the centroid of a label at the current zoom.
- Change the color of individual labels.
- Erase all drawn pixels of a given label.
- Restore an erased label.

Version >=0.1.0 works for napari version >= 0.5.5

Version <0.1.0 should work for napari version < 0.4.19

## Usage
Start the plugin `Plugins > Annotator (Annotator)`.

The plugin will list available labels once a labels layer is selected and labels drawn.

Color shuffling for labels will not work, since the plugin sets the color mode of the layer to `direct`.
But you can always change the color of individual labels, using the color picker.

## Known limitations
1. Locating / moving to the center of a label only works on 2D/3D label layers, i.e.:
   1. single- / multi-channel 2D label layers.
   2. single-channel 3D label layers (the third dimension being either Z or T).
2. (Theoretical) maximum of 20'000 labels supported.
<!-- increasing the number is possible, but will introduce bigger lag, as each color/visibility change re-creates the colormap.-->
3. Restoring an erased labels is lost after switching between layers.

## Installation

Before you can operate the module, you must install the `napari-apple` module.

### Instruction for napari-module

You can install `napari-apple` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-apple

To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/hereariim/napari-apple.git

## How does it works

Here, user drop its images in the napari windows. The plugin shows two widgets : 
- Image detection
- Export data

In Image detection, user select the interesting layer to detect apple. The ""Run"" button run the inference detection based on Yolov4-tiny model. At the end, the result is displayed on screen. User can correct freely the detection by removing or adding box in image.

In Export data, user export select the interesting shape layer and RGB image. A button ""Save to csv"" save bounding box coordinate in Yolo way into a text file.

A simple plugin to create and view APR images in napari

## Usage

To get started, open an image of your choice (2D or 3D grayscale) in napari and open the `convert_image_to_apr` panel. Select the image layer to convert, an appropriate data type, and hit `Run`. 

**Note:** choosing a data type smaller than the input type may lead to overflow and thus erroneous results.

Conversion parameters can often be left to their default values, thanks to the automatic parameter tuning. For very noisy images, it is sometimes useful to increase the `smoothing` parameter. In order to get a more (or less) aggressive adaptation, change the `relative error` parameter.

![conversion.png](https://github.com/AdaptiveParticles/napari-apr-viewer/raw/main/docs/conversion.png)

To save the result to file, simply save the newly created layer using the `File` menu. We use the extension `.apr`, although the file is actually written in `hdf5` format (and can be opened/explored as such). In this example, the APR is roughly 80 times smaller than the original image on disk. APR files can be opened directly in napari, e.g. by drag and drop.

![apr_file.png](https://github.com/AdaptiveParticles/napari-apr-viewer/raw/main/docs/apr_file.png)

To better understand the workings of the APR on your data, you can use the `APR Viewer` panel to change the `View mode` for a selected APR layer to `level`. This shows you a visualization of the adaptive resolution. Particles in the brightest regions correspond exactly to pixels (lossless), while each shade darker corresponds to downsampling by a factor of 2 in each dimension.

![view_level.png](https://github.com/AdaptiveParticles/napari-apr-viewer/raw/main/docs/view_level.png)

The `Downsample` slider can be used to reduce the resolution of the displayed data for the selected layer. This can be used to explore large volumes in 3D, where rendering the full data requires too much memory. 

**Note:** We do not offer APR-native rendering at this time, so this step will reconstruct the entire pixel volume (at the selected resolution). Thus, for large volumes, be sure to increase the downsampling before toggling the 3D viewer.

![view_3D_ds.png](https://github.com/AdaptiveParticles/napari-apr-viewer/raw/main/docs/view_3D_downsampled.png)

## Description

This plugin is a tool to count the number of aphids from two models developed on ilastik. Implemented in napari, this tool allows the correction of pixels and labels that are not well 
predicted. 

In this plugin we find our two main parts of the aphid counting model presented in two widgets. A third widget allows to save the updates applied on the segmentation mask.

This plugin is an use cas, dedicated to private use of french laboratory.

## Plugin input

### Segmentation

The user must give two objects as input:

- Compressed file in .zip format
- Ilastik pixel classification model in .ilp format

In particular, compressed file must be organized as follows:

            └── Arean.im_n.h5
```

In each folder Area1, Area2, ..., Arean, we notice that **each tif image is accompanied by its h5 version**. The images in h5 format were generated by the Export h5 widget of the Ilastik plugin in the ImageJ software.

### Classification

The user must give the Ilastik object classification model in .ilp format.

## Widget: Image segmentation

This widget is a tool to segment a set of images. It takes as input a compressed file of images and an ilastik segmentation model. A Run button is used to start the image segmentation process. In the background, the console presents the progress status. This widget returns a menu which is a list of processed images. This list allows an RGB image and its segmentation mask to be displayed in the napari window.

![segmentation_cpe](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93375163/212323051-bc84d597-a9ff-46ca-b897-cb18a0e77b4c.png)

**User conduct :** In this widget, the user corrects the image with the annotation tools (brush and eraser only). With the brush, he/she has to add the same colour presented in the image. To obtain this colour, the user can take the color with the color picker tool. With the eraser, he/she erase colour not well predicted. Tous les annotations appliquées dans l'image doit être sauvegarder avec le bouton *Save* du widget **Save modification**

## Widget: Save modification

This is the backup of the segmentation mask. It saves updates applied to the mask.

## Widget: Object classification

This widget is a tool to classify segmented images. It takes as input an ilastik object classification model. A Run button is used to start the classification process. In the background, the console shows the progress of the image processing. This widget returns a menu that lists the processed images. This list provides two elements. The first is the display of the selected image in the window. The second is the display of a table that shows the predicted classes for each object.

![classification_cpe](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93375163/212323369-32423622-4f41-4dcb-800b-39ff66be67f9.png)

**User conduct :** In this widget, the user corrects labels not well predicted in the table at the bottom right. He must not forget to save his correction with the Save button.
When the user has finished with all his images, he uses the Export button to import a quantitative table. This table contains for each image, the name of the aphid type and its size in pixels.

***
## Intro

napari-annotatorj has several convenient functions to speed up the annotation process, make it easier and more fun. These *modes* can be activated by their corresponding checkboxes on the left side of the main AnnotatorJ widget.

- [Contour assist mode](#contour-assist-mode)
- [Edit mode](#edit-mode)
- [Class mode](#class-mode)
- [Overlay](#overlay)

Freehand drawing is enabled in the plugin. The ""Add polygon"" tool is selected by default upon startup. To draw a freehand object (shape) simply hold the mouse and drag it around the object. The contour is visualized when the mouse button is released.

See the [guide](#how-to-annotate) below for a quick start or a [demo](#demo). See [shortcuts](#shortcuts) for easy operation.

***
## How to annotate

1. Open --> opens an image
2. (Optionally) 
	- ... --> Select annotation type --> Ok --> a default tool is selected from the toolbar that fits the selected annotation type
	- The default annotation type is instance
	- Selected annotation type is saved to a config file
3. Start annotating objects
	- [instance](#instance-annotation): draw contours around objects
	- [semantic](#semantic-annotation): paint the objects' area
	- [bounding box](#bounding-box-annotation): draw rectangles around the objects
4. Save --> Select class --> saves the annotation to a file in a sub-folder of the original image folder with the name of the selected class

5. (Optionally)
	- Load --> continue a previous annotation
	- Overlay --> display a different annotation as overlay (semi-transparent) on the currently opened image
	- Colours --> select annotation and overlay colours
	- ... (coming soon) --> set options for semantic segmentation and *Contour assist* mode
	- checkboxes --> Various options
		- (default) Add automatically --> adds the most recent annotation to the ROI list automatically when releasing the left mouse button
		- Smooth (coming soon) --> smooths the contour (in instance annotation type only)
		- Show contours --> displays all the contours in the ROI list
		- Contours assist --> suggests a contour in the region of an initial, lazily drawn contour using the deep learning method U-Net
		- Show overlay --> displays the overlayed annotation if loaded with the Overlay button
		- Edit mode --> edits a selected, already saved contour in the ROI list by clicking on it on the image
		- Class mode --> assigns the selected class to the selected contour in the ROI list by clicking on it on the image and displays its contour in the class's colour (can be set in the Class window); clicking on the object a second time unclassifies it
	- [^] --> quick export in 16-bit multi-labelled .tiff format; if classified, also exports by classes

***
## Instance annotation
Allows freehand drawing of object contours (shapes) with the mouse as in ImageJ.

Shape contour points are tracked automatically when the left mouse button is held and dragged to draw a shape. The shape is closed when the mouse button is released, automatically, and added to the default shapes layer (named ""ROI""). In direct selection mode (from the layer controls panel), you can see the saved contour points. The slower you drag the mouse, the more contour points saved, i.e. the more refined your contour will be.

***
## Semantic annotation
Allows painting with the brush tool (labels).

Useful for semantic (e.g. scene) annotation. Currently saves all labels to binary mask only (foreground-background).

***
## Bounding box annotation
Allows drawing bounding boxes (shapes, rectangles) around objects with the mouse.

Useful for object detection annotation.

***
## Contour assist mode
Assisted annotation via a pre-trained deep learning model's suggested contour.

1. initialize a contour with mouse drag around an object
2. the suggested contour is displayed automatically
3. modify the contour:
    - edit with mouse drag or 
    - erase holding ""Alt"" or
	- invert with pressing ""u""
4. finalize it
    - accept with pressing ""q"" or
    - reject with pressing ""Ctrl"" + ""Del""

- if the suggested contour is a merge of multiple objects, you can erase the dividing line around the object you wish to keep, and keep erasing (or splitting with the eraser) until the object you wish to keep is the largest, then press ""q"" to accept it
- this mode requires a Keras model to be present in the [model folder](#configure-model-folder)

***
## Edit mode
Allows to modify created objects with a brush tool.

1. select an object (shape) to modify by clicking on it
2. an editing layer (labels layer) is created for painting automatically
3. modify the contour:
    - edit with mouse drag or 
    - erase holding ""Alt""
4. finalize it
    - accept with pressing ""q"" or
    - delete with pressing ""Ctrl"" + ""Del"" or
    - revert changes with pressing ""Esc"" (to the state before editing)

- if the edited contour is a merge of multiple objects, you can erase the dividing line around the object you wish to keep, and keep erasing (or splitting with the eraser) until the object you wish to keep is the largest, then press ""q"" to accept it

***
## Class mode
Allows to assign class labels to objects by clicking on shapes.

1. select a class from the class list to assign
2. click on an object (shape) to assign the selected class label to it
3. the contour colour of the clicked object will be updated to the selected class colour, plus the class label is updated in the text properties of object (turn on ""display text"" on the layer control panel to see the text properties as `objectID:(classLabel)` e.g. 1:(0) for the first object)

- optionally, you can set a default class for all currently unlabelled objects on the ROI (shapes) layer by selecting a class from the drop-down menu on the right to the text label ""Default class""
- class colours can be changed with the drop-down menu right to the class list; upon selection, all objects whose class label is the currently selected class will have their contour colour updated to the selected colour
- clicking on an object that has already been assigned a class label will unclassify it: assign the label *0* to it

## Export
See also: [Quick export](#quick-export)

The exporter plugin AnnotatorJExport can be invoked from the Plugins menu under the plugin name `napari-annotatorj`. It is used for batch export of annotations to various formats directly suitable to train different types of deep learning models. See a [demonstrative figure](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spreka/annotatorj/master/demos/annotation_and_export_types.png) in the [AnnotatorJ repository](https://github.com/spreka/annotatorj) and further description in its [README](https://github.com/spreka/annotatorj#export) or [documentation](https://github.com/spreka/annotatorj/blob/master/AnnotatorJ_documentation.pdf).

1. browse original image folder with either the
    - ""Browse original..."" button or
    - text input field next to it
2. browse annotation folder with either the
    - ""Browse annot..."" button or
    - text input field next to it
3. select the export options you wish to export the annotations to (see tooltips on hover for help)
    - at least one export option must be selected to start export
    - (optional) right click on the checkbox ""Coordinates"" to switch between the default COCO format and YOLO format; see [explanation](#coordinate-formats)
4. click on ""Export masks"" to start the export
    - this will open a progress bar in the napari window and close it upon finish

The folder structure required by the exporter is as follows:

```
image_folder
	|--- image1.png
	|--- another_image.png
	|--- something.png
	|--- ...

annotation_folder
	|--- image1_ROIs.zip
	|--- another_image_ROIs.zip
	|--- something_ROIs.zip
	|--- ...
```

Multiple export options can be selected at once, any selected will create a subfolder in the folder where the annotations are saved.

[![exporter-demo](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1QoaJrI9pKziUzYwiZNdWlfRD7PcvJB9U)](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1uJz-x_ypEOjc7SYPUTqrEt0ieyNLFy6u ""Click to watch exporter demo"")

***
## Quick export
Click on the ""[^]"" button to quickly save annotations and export to mask image. It saves the current annotations (shapes) to an ImageJ-compatible roi.zip file and a generated a 16-bit multi-labelled mask image to the subfolder ""masks"" under the current original image's folder.


***
## Coordinate formats
In the AnnotatorJExport plugin 2 coordinates formats can be selecting by right clicking on the Coordinates checkbox: COCO or YOLO. The default is COCO.

*COCO format*:
- `[x, y, width, height]` based on the top-left corner of the bounding box around the object
- coordinates are not normalized
- annotations are saved with header to 
    - .csv file
    - tab delimeted

*YOLO format*:
- `[class, x, y, width, height]` based on the center point of the bounding box around the object
- coordinates are normalized to the image size as floating point values between 0 and 1
- annotations are saved with header to
    - .txt file
    - whitespace delimeted
    - class is saved as the 1st column

***
## Overlay
A separate annotation file can be loaded as overlay for convenience, e.g. to compare annotations.

1. load another annotation file with the ""Overlay"" button

- (optional) switch its visibility with the ""Show overlay"" checkbox
- (optional) change the contour colour of the overlay shapes with the [""Colours"" button](#change-colours)

***
## Change colours
Clicking on the ""Colours"" button opens the Colours widget where you can set the annotation and overlay colours.

1. select a colour from the drop-down list either next to the text label ""overlay"" or ""annotation""
2. click the ""Ok"" button to apply changes

- contour colour of shapes on the annotation shapes layer (named ""ROI"") that already have a class label assigned to them will **not** be updated to the new annotation colour, only those not having a class label (the class label can be displayed with the ""display text"" checkbox on the layer controls panel as `objectID:(classLabel)` e.g. 1:(0) for the first object)
- contour colour of shapes on the overlay shapes layer (named ""overlay"") will all have the overlay colour set, regardless of any existing class information saved to the annotation file loaded as overlay

***
## Configure model folder
The Contour assist mode imports a pre-trained Keras model from a folder named *models* under exactly the path *napari_annotatorj*. This is automatically created on the first startup in your user folder:
- `C:\Users\Username\.napari_annotatorj` on Windows
- `\home\username\.napari_annotatorj` on Linux

A pre-trained model for nucleus segmentation is automatically downloaded from the GitHub repository of the [ImageJ version of AnnotatorJ](https://github.com/spreka/annotatorj/releases/tag/v0.0.2-model). The model will be saved to `[your user folder]\.napari_annotatorj\models\model_real.h5`. This location is printed to the console (command prompt or powershell on Windows, terminal on Linux).

(deprecated) When bulding from source the model folder is located at *path\to\napari-annotatorj\src\napari_annotatorj\models* whereas installing from pypi it is located at *path\to\virtualenv\Lib\site-packages\napari_annotatorj\models*.

The model must be in either of these file formats:
- config .json file + weights file: *model_real.json* and *model_real_weights.h5*
- combined weights file: *model_real.hdf5*

You can also train a new model on your own data in e.g. Python and save it with this code block:

```python
	# save model as json
	model_json=model.to_json()
	with open(‘model_real.json’, ‘w’) as f:
		f.write(model_json)
	
	# save weights too
	model.save_weights(‘model_real_weights.h5’)

```
You can also train in the [train widget](#Training).

This configuration will change in the next release to allow model browse and custom model name in an [options widget](#options).

***
## Training
To start training a new model or refine an existing one click the **Train** button on the right of the napari-annotatorj widget. This will open the training widget where you can set input paths and training options. During training a progress bar will show the epochs passed and plot the loss on a graph. See a [guide](#how-to-train) below.

The trained model will be saved to the `model` folder under the located training data folder which is named `training` by default when preparing data. Each new training will be saved to a new training folder with increased numbering e.g. `training_1`, `training_2` etc.

When an existing training data folder is browsed with the ""Browse train ..."" button, the `model` folder will be created under it without an additiona `training` folder.

After training is finished, a message is shown to indicate the newly trained model can be tested by drawing bounding boxes (rectangles) to initiate [contour assist](#contour-assist-mode) prediction. The presented region on the editing layer (Label layer) can be modified with the paint brush tool (automatically selected) as in [contour assist](#contour-assist-mode).

The trained model can be further refined by selecting the ""Retrain latest"" checkbox from the [training parameters](#training-parameters) (⚙ button on the right).

To use this new model for annotation in [contour assist mode](#contour-assist-mode), you mush set the model path in the [Options widget](#options) or in the configuration file (see how to [here](#configure-model-folder)), then restart napari.

### How to train
1. On current annotation
	1. ""Use current annotation"" checkbox --> use this image and its current annotation for training
	2. Prep data --> prepare data to [suitable format](#training-data-format)
	3. (optional) ⚙ --> [set parameters](#training-parameters)
	4. Start --> start training
2. Additional data
	1. Select images and annotations to use for training
		- Browse original ... --> locate folder of original images
		- Browse annot ... --> locate folder of annotations
		- Prep data --> prepare data to [suitable format](#training-data-format)
	2. Browse train ... --> select already prepared training data
	3. (optional) ⚙ --> [set parameters](#training-parameters)
	4. Start --> start training

### Training data format
The data format expected by the training widget is as follows.

```
images
	|--- image1.png
	|--- another_image.png
	|--- something.png
	|--- ...

unet_masks
	|--- image1.tiff
	|--- another_image.tiff
	|--- something.tiff
	|--- ...
```

Masks are 8-bit binary (black and white) .tiff images that can be exported from the [Exporter widget](#export) selecting the Semantic (binary) export option. When the ""Prep data"" button is clicked in the Training widget, these folders are automatically created from the located annotation files and original images.

### Training parameters
The following configurable parameters can be set after clicking on the ⚙ icon:
| Parameter | Description | Default value |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| Epochs | number of epochs to train | 5 |
| Steps | number of steps in each epoch | 1 |
| Batch size | number of samples in an iteration| 1 |
| Image size | size of training images | 256 |
| Start from scratch | train a new model from scratch| `False` |
| Retrain latest | re-fine latest training | `False` |
| Write pred | write test image prediction to file| `False` |
| Test image | path to test image | `None`|

Note: by default CPU will be used for training. This can be changed to GPU in the [Options widget](#options) if your computer has a capable CUDA-device.

***
## Options
Settings found in the configuration file can be set in the Options widget opened with the ""..."" button on the right of the main plugin. For changes to take effect you must save your changes with the ""Ok"" button at the bottom of the Options widget.

## Setting device for deep learning model prediction
The [Contour assist](#contour-assist-mode) mode uses a pre-trained U-Net model for suggesting contours based on a lazily initialized contour drawn by the user. The default configuration loads and runs the model on the CPU so all users can run it. It is possible to switch to GPU if you have:
- a CUDA-capable GPU in your computer
- nVidia's CUDA toolkit + cuDNN installed

See installation guide on [nVidia's website](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) according to your system.

To switch to GPU utilization, edit [_dock_widget.py](https://github.com/spreka/napari-annotatorj/blob/main/src/napari_annotatorj/_dock_widget.py#L112) and set to the device you would like to use. Valid values are `'cpu','0','1','2',...`. The default value is `cpu`. The default GPU device is `0` if your system has any CUDA-capable GPU. If the device you set cannot be found or utilized by the code, it will fall back to `cpu`. An informative message is printed to the console upon plugin startup.

A plugin to read Dioptic ARGOS archive files

----------------------------------

This repo contains a reader plugin for [DIOPTIC ARGOS](https://www.dioptic.de/en/argos-en/) Archive files, which
have `.zip` file extension.
Individual ARGOS layers are grouped into napari layer with stacks according to
their illumination, stage XY position and Z-stack information.

The plugin implements delayed reading using `dask.delayed` so that one can quickly
see the contents even for large archives with many layers. Note!: switching to
volume rendering or swapping axes can trigger the loading of all ARGOS layers, which
can take a long time for large archives.

[ARGOS](https://www.dioptic.de/en/argos-en/) is an automated system
for surface inspection according to ISO 10110-7.

This plugin is still experimental and does not support all features of ARGOS archives.

Currently, the plugin

* can read Argos matrix archives containing regular image layers including:
  * ✅ segmentation masks
  * ✅ Z-stack metadata
  * ✅ Illumination metadata
  * ✅ proper scaling and affine transformation of layers
* can read ❔✅ Argos line scan (polar) archives with minimal support (no metadata parsing)
This has not been tested on many archives.

Not supported are:

* ❌ annotated archives
* ❌ pyramid image structures
* ❌ Line segmentation metadata
* ❌ color metadata
* ❌ ...

## Usage

### Opening files

Simply drag and drop an ARGOS Archive `.zip` file onto the napari canvas or use `File->Open` to open it.

### Synchronizing contrast limits

By default, after reading an archive, each napari layer will have their own contrast limits, so you can
adjust these contrast limits individually.

The reader plugin registers a custom key binding after reading an ARGOS archive. Pressing the `s` key will allow
you to synchronize the contrast limits for a set of layers:

* If you select _a single_ napari layer corresponding to an image/stack from an ARGOS archive, all napari image
layers that were loaded from this archive now have their contrast limits synchronized, i.e. changing the
contrast limits of _any_ of them will adjust the contrast limits of _all_ of the layers belonging to the same
archive.
* If you select _multiple_ napari layers and press `s` all of these and only these napari layers will have
their contrast limits synchronized, regardless of whether they belong to the same ARGOS archive or not.

## Installation

If you have napari installed you can install the plugin from the napari hub through the `Plugins -> Plugin Manger` menu
entry. After waiting a short while for napari to retrieve the plugins available from the hub, simply enter ""argos"" in
the filter line entry field at the top to narrow down the plugin list and click install.

You can install `napari-argos-archive-reader` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-argos-archive-reader

# Arboretum



https://github.com/lowe-lab-ucl/arboretum/assets/8217795/d98c22c4-73bb-493a-9f8f-c224d615209d


_Automated cell tracking and lineage tree reconstruction_.

### Overview

A dockable widget for [Napari](https://github.com/napari/napari) for visualizing cell lineage trees.

Features:

- Lineage tree plot widget
- Integration with [btrack](https://github.com/quantumjot/btrack)

---

### Usage

Once installed, Arboretum will be visible in the `Plugins > Add Dock Widget > napari-arboretum` menu in napari. To visualize a lineage tree, (double) click on one of the tracks in a napari `Tracks` layer.

### Examples

You can use the example script to display some sample tracking data in napari and load the arboretum tree viewer:

### General Usage

This plugin expects a stack of tiles as input. Mosaic images should be deconstructed into their tiled components before processing. Individual tiles should be two-dimensional.

There are many options to customize the performance of BaSiCPy. Please refer to the BaSiCPy documentation on parameters [here](https://basicpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#basicpy.basicpy.BaSiC) for details.

The napari-assistant is a [napari](https://github.com/napari/napari) meta-plugin for building image processing workflows. 

## Usage

After installing one or more napari plugins that use the napari-assistant as user interface, you can start it from the 
menu `Tools > Utilities > Assistant (na)` or run `naparia` from the command line. 

By clicking on the buttons in the assistant, you can setup a workflow for processing the images.

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-assistant/raw/main/docs/napari-assistant-screenshot.png)

While setting up your workflow, you can at any point select a layer from the layer list (1) and change the parameters of
the corresponding operation (2). The layer will update when you change parameters and also all subsequent operations. 
You can also vary which operation is applied to the image (3). Also make sure the right input image layer is selected (4).

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-assistant/raw/main/docs/design_workflows.png)

### Saving and loading workflows

You can also save and load workflows to disk. 

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-assistant/raw/main/docs/save_and_load.png)

After loading a workflow, make sure that the right input images are selected.

### Code generation

The napari-assistant allows exporting the given workflow as Python script and Jupyter Notebook. 

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-assistant/raw/main/docs/code_generator.png)

Furthermore, if you have the [napari-script-editor](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-script-editor) installed,
you can also send the current workflow as code to the script editor from the same menu.

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-assistant/raw/main/docs/napari_script_editor.png)

### Plugin generation

There is also a Napari plugin generator available. Check out [its documentation](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-assistant-plugin-generator) to learn how napari-assistant compatible plugins can be generated directly from within the assistant.

## Installation

It is recommended to install the napari-assistant via one of the plugins that use it as graphical user interface.
You find a complete list of plugins that use the assistant [on the napari-hub](https://www.napari-hub.org/?search=napari-assistant&sort=relevance).
Multiple of these plugins come bundled when installing [devbio-napari](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/devbio-napari).
Note: This plugin is not compatible with napari 0.6.0 and later.

## For developers

If you want to make your napari-plugin accessible from the napari-assistant, consider programming functions with a simple 
interface that consume images, labels, integers, floats and strings. Annotate input and return types, e.g. like this:
```python
def example_function_widget(image: ""napari.types.ImageData"") -> ""napari.types.LabelsData"":
    from skimage.filters import threshold_otsu
    binary_image = image > threshold_otsu(image)

    from skimage.measure import label
    return label(binary_image)
```

Furthermore, please add your function to the napari.yaml which uses [npe2](https://github.com/napari/npe2):
```
name: napari-npe2-test
display_name: napari-npe2-test
contributions:
  commands: 
    - id: napari-npe2-test.make_magic_widget
      python_name: napari_npe2_test._widget:example_magic_widget
      title: Make example magic widget
  widgets:
    - command: napari-npe2-test.make_magic_widget
      display_name: Segmentation / labeling > Otsu Labeling (nnpe2t)
```

To put it in the right button within the napari-assistant, please use one of the following prefixes for the `display_name`:
* `Filtering / noise removal > `
* `Filtering / background removal > `
* `Filtering > `
* `Image math > `
* `Transform > `
* `Projection > `
* `Segmentation / binarization > `
* `Segmentation / labeling > `
* `Segmentation post-processing > `
* `Measurement > `
* `Label neighbor filters > `
* `Label filters > `
* `Visualization > `

You find a fully functional example [here](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-npe2-test).

Last but not least, to make your napari-plugin is listed in the napari-hub when searching for ""napari-assistant"", make sure
you mention it in your `readme`.

## Feedback welcome!

The napari-assistant is developed in the open because we believe in the open source community. Feel free to drop feedback as [github issue](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-assistant/issues) or via [image.sc](https://image.sc)

## Installation

You can install `napari-bee-annotator` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-bee-annotator



To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/EPFL-Center-for-Imaging/napari-bee-annotator.git

## Getting started

1. Open napari with the plugin and your video using the following command `napari -w napari-bee-annotator --plugin video path/to/video.mp4`. Note that you need to have [napari_video](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari_video) installed to read `mp4` files.

2. Select the orientation of your video: horizontal/vertical refers to the direction of the bee's leaving/entering the hive.

3. Start annotating: A simple left click indicates a bee moving up or to the left depending on the orientation selected. You can hold down the shift key to annotate a bee moving down or to the right. Annotations can be deleted with a right click on the annotation you want to delete. To move to the next frame, you can either hold down `ctrl` and scroll with the mouse wheel or click on the play button. Playback parameters, such as the playback speed, can be changed by right clicking on the play button.

4. Saving and loading tracks: To save a tracks layer selected from the list of layers and click on `File > Save selected layers`. Choose a name and the csv extension. If you want to continue to work on the annotations for a specific video, you first have to load the corresponding csv file by clicking on `Open with Plugin > Open file(s)...`. Select the file you want to load and click on open. A dialog should pop up that asks you to select the reader to use for loading the csv file. Select `Bee annotator`. Lastly, you have to tell the plugin to interact with the layer you just loaded by selecting it in the `Tracks layer` drop down menu.

A napari-plugin providing an alternative GUI for [Big-FISH](https://github.com/fish-quant/big-fish). Big-FISH is a python package for the analysis of smFISH images.

The plugin provides a graphical user interface for some of the functionality in Big-FISH. Currently implemented are:

 * Gaussian-background subtraction
 * FISH-spot detection with 
	* Elimination of duplicates
	* Auto-detection of threshold
* Dense-region decomposition

The plugin further implements by itself:

* Counting of spots per cell, inside and outside of the nucleus
* Batch processing on a list of images

# Description

View datasets archived at the **[Brain Image Library](https://www.brainimagelibrary.org/)**.

**NOTE: This plugin is under early development.  Currently, only a subset of single-channel, fMOST datasets which include projections are available to view.  An example can be found [here]( https://download.brainimagelibrary.org/2b/da/2bdaf9e66a246844/mouseID_405429-182725/).



![Plugin Demo GIF](https://imgur.com/gkDCsMd.gif ""Plugin Demo GIF"")



### Features

* Multiscale Rendering
  * In datasets that include multiple resolution representations of the data, each resolution can be combined to improve the speed of browsing and user experience.  An example of a dataset with multiple resolution projections can be found [here](https://download.brainimagelibrary.org/2b/da/2bdaf9e66a246844/mouseID_405429-182725/).
  * All datasets included in the current release of napari-bil-data-viewer use multi-resolution datasets.
* 3D rendering of whole datasets.  The lowest resolution is used for rendering.  Currently, this is a limitation imposed by napari.
* The plugin does NOT require a BIL account as datasets are already accessible via https.

### Known Issues / limitations
* Currently the only datasets that are available are those which have been manually selected by the developers.  If you would like a specific dataset to be included please consider adding the dataset(s) to the [dataset_info.py](https://github.com/brain-image-library/napari-bil-data-viewer/blob/main/napari_bil_data_viewer/dataset_info.py) file and submitting a pull request.
* To inquire about this plugin please contact Brain Image Library support:  bil-support@psc.edu
* The plugin is still under development.  We appreciate all [reports of issues / errors](https://github.com/brain-image-library/napari-bil-data-viewer/issues) which occur during use.

An annotator tool collection by the BIOMAG group.

This plugin allows object annotation on 2/3D images using 4 assisted annotation methods arising from two napari plugins:

- [napari-annotatorj](https://github.com/spreka/napari-annotatorj)
- [napari-nD-annotator](https://github.com/bauerdavid/napari-nD-annotator)

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/stable/plugins/index.html
-->

## Installation

You can install `napari-biomag-annotator` via [pip]:

    pip install napari[all]
    pip install napari-biomag-annotator



To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/biomag-lab/napari-biomag-annotator.git


On Linux distributions, the following error may arise upon napari startup after the installation of the plugin: `Could not load the Qt platform plugin “xcb” in “” even though it was found`. In this case, the manual install of `libxcb-xinerama0` for Qt is required:

    sudo apt install libxcb-xinerama0

### Bundled napari app
The bundled application version of [napari](https://github.com/napari/napari/releases) allows the pip install of plugins in the .zip distribution. After installation of this release, napari-annotatorj can be installed from the `Plugins --> Install/Uninstall plugins...` menu by searching for its name and clicking on the `Install` button next to it.

### Script
Single-file install is supported on [**Windows**](#windows) and [Linux](#linux) (currently). It will create a virtual environment named `napariAnnotatorEnv` in the parent folder of the cloned repository, install the package via pip and start napari. It requires a valid Python install.

#### Windows
To start it, run in the Command prompt

    git clone https://github.com/biomag-lab/napari-biomag-annotator.git
    cd napari-biomag-annotator
    install.bat

Or download [install.bat](https://github.com/biomag-lab/napari-biomag-annotator/blob/main/install.bat) and run it from the Command prompt.

After install, you can use [startup_napari.bat](https://github.com/biomag-lab/napari-biomag-annotator/blob/main/startup_napari.bat) to activate your installed virtual environment and run napari. Run it from the Command prompt with:

    startup_napari.bat


#### Linux
To start it, run in the Terminal

    git clone https://github.com/biomag-lab/napari-biomag-annotator.git

Bioformats plugin for napari using
[pims-bioformats](http://soft-matter.github.io/pims/v0.5/bioformats.html)

----------------------------------

## Use this plugin as a fallback!

Anyone coming to napari from the Fiji/ImageJ world will likely be aware of the
_incredible_ [Bio-Formats](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/6.6.1/index.html)
library.  A heroic effort, built over years, to read
[more than a 100 file formats](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/6.6.1/supported-formats.html).  Naturally, we want some of that goodness for `napari` ... hence this plugin.

**However:** it's important to note that this plugin _still_
requires having a java runtime engine installed.  This is easy enough to do
(the plugin will ask to install it for you if you're in a `conda` environment), but
it definitely makes for a more complicated environment setup, it's not very
""pythonic"", and the performance will likely not feel as snappy as a native ""pure""
python module.

So, before you reflexively install this plugin to fill that bio-formats
sized hole in your python heart, consider trying some of the other pure-python
plugins designed to read your format of interest:

- **Zeiss (.czi)**: [napari-aicsimageio](https://github.com/AllenCellModeling/napari-aicsimageio), [napari-czifile2](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/napari-czifile2)
- **Nikon (.nd2)**: [napari-nikon-nd2](https://github.com/cwood1967/napari-nikon-nd2), [nd2-dask](https://github.com/DragaDoncila/nd2-dask)
- **Leica (.lif)**: [napari-aicsimageio](https://github.com/AllenCellModeling/napari-aicsimageio)
- **Olympus (.oif)**: no plugin?  (but see [oiffile](https://pypi.org/project/oiffile/) )
- **DeltaVision (.dv, .mrc)**: [napari-dv](https://github.com/tlambert03/napari-dv)

> *if you have a pure-python reader for a bio-formats-supported file format that
you'd like to see added to this list, please open an issue*

## Installation

The easiest way to install `napari-bioformats` is via [conda], from the
[conda-forge] channel:

    conda install -c conda-forge napari-bioformats

It is also possible to install via [pip], but you will need to have a working
JVM installed, and may need to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable

    pip install napari-bioformats

### First Usage

The first time you attempt to open a file with napari-bioformats, you will
likely notice a long delay as pims downloads the `loci_tools.jar` (speed will
depend on your internet connection). Subsequent files should open more quickly.

napari plugin for managing AI models in the [BioImage Model Zoo](https://bioimage.io).

> **WARNING**: This is an alpha release. The API may change in future versions, and please feel free to create issues to report bugs or provide feedbacks.

![](assets/screenshot-model-manager-1.png)

## Installation

```
pip install napari-bioimageio
```

(If you don't have napari installed, run `pip install napari[pyqt5]`)

## Usage

This library is meant for helping developers to ease the handling of models in napari.

We provide a set of API functions for managing and selecting models.
### `show_model_manager()`
Show the model manager with a model list pulled from the BioImage Model Zoo, the user can explore all the available models, download or remove models.

### `show_model_selector(filter=None)`
Display a dialog for selecting models from the BioImage Model Zoo, the user can either select an existing model or download from the BioImage Model Zoo.

The selecte model information (a dictionary) will be returned if the user selected a model, otherwise it returns `None`.

Once the user selected the model, you can access the name, and also the file path to the model resource description file (via the `rdf_source` key). With the `bioimageio.core` library (installed via `pip install bioimageio.core` or `conda install -c conda-forge bioimageio.core`), you can run inference directly, the following examples shows how to implement it:

```python
# Popup a model selection dialog for choosing the model
model_info = show_model_selector(filter=nuclear_segmentation_model_filter)

if model_info:
  self.nucseg_model_source = model_info[""rdf_source""]
  # Load model 
  model_description = bioimageio.core.load_resource_description(model_info[""rdf_source""])
  input_image = imageio.imread(""./my-image.tif"")

  with bioimageio.core.create_prediction_pipeline(
      bioimageio_model=model_description
  ) as pipeline:
    output_image = bioimageio.core.prediction.predict_with_padding(
        pipeline, input_image, padding=padding
    )
```
Note: To run the models, you need to setup the conda environment properly according to the [installation guide of bioimageio.core](https://github.com/bioimage-io/core-bioimage-io-python#installation).

For more examples, see [this example notebook](https://github.com/bioimage-io/core-bioimage-io-python/blob/main/example/bioimageio-core-usage.ipynb) for `bioimageio.core`.

You can also access the weight files directly by searching the model folder (e.g. extract the model folder path via `os.path.dirname(model_description[""rdf_source""])`), this will be useful if you prefer to use your own model inference logic.
### `show_model_uploader()`
Display a dialog to instruct the user to upload a model package to the BioImage Model Zoo.
Currently, it only shows a message, in the future, we will try to support direct uploading with user's credentials obtained from Zenodo (a public data repository used by the BioImage Model Zoo to store models).

To create a BioImageIO-compatible model package, you can use the `build_model` function as demonstrated in [this notebook]((https://github.com/bioimage-io/core-bioimage-io-python/blob/main/example/bioimageio-core-usage.ipynb)).

## Bleach correction for napari

This plugin is a python implementation of three different algorithms for bleach correction and can be used 
to correct time-lapse images that lose intensity due to photobleaching. The implementation is based on the ImageJ 
plugin Bleach Corrector by Miura et al. All methods work with 2D and 3D time series.

Napari Bleach correction is easy to use:

![Demo](./data/demo.gif)

### Ratio Method

This is the simplest method. Every pixel in a frame is multiplied by the ratio from the mean intensity of the 
first frame to that of the *i-th* frame.

Assumptions:
* the mean intensity is constant through the time-lapse
* the background fluorescence is the same for every pixel and frame

Parameters:
* Background Intensity: Must be estimated

### Exponential Curve Fitting

Drift estimation of fluorescence signal by fitting the mean intensity to an exponential curve.
The image is corrected by the decay in the normalized exponential function.

Assumptions:
* time intervals between frames are equal

Parameters:
* Exponential Curve: Bleaching can be modelled as a mono- or bi-exponential curve

### Histogram Matching

Bleaching correction by matching histograms to a reference image.
The correct pixel values can be calculated by the cumulative distribution function
of a frame and its reference frame. This method introduced by Miura et al.

Parameters:
* Reference Frame: Match the frame's histogram with the first our neighbor frame 

**The Histogram Matching method using the neighbor frame as reference is a good start to correct bleaching.**
All methods are described in detail in Miura et al.

Detects blobs in images

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/plugins/stable/index.html
-->

This plugin consists of two widgets:

1. Detects blobs on images
2. Convert points layer to labels layer

----------------------------------

### Detects blobs on images

This widget uses [scikit-image's blob detection algorithms](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/features_detection/plot_blob.html) to detect bright blobs on dark backgrounds.

Parameters

- method: Laplacian of Gaussian (most accurate) or Difference of Gaussian (faster approximation) 
- image: Image layer for blob detection. Can be a 2D, 3D, or higher dimensionality image.
- dimensionality: users can specify if the image is 2D(+t) or 3D(+t).
- min sigma: the smallest blob size to detect
- max sigma: the largest blob size to detect
- threshold: the lower the threshold, the more low intensity blobs are detected. 

Output

Blobs are represented by the Points layer.
The size of each blob is proportional to `Points.feature['sigma']`,
which signifies the scale at which the feature point was found.

### Convert points layer to labels layer

This widget takes a points layer and converts it into a labels layer, with the image dimension matching the selected image layer.
By converting points to labels, users can leverage feature extraction functions that are available to labels to the detected points.

----------------------------------

This plugin turns 2D grayscale images into 3D-printable landscape tiles for a certain all-time tabletop boardgame which revolves around building settlements, obtaining ressources expanding and collecting more points than your opponents.

In short, images (for instance, [digital elevation models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_elevation_model)) can be turned into surfaces like this:

| Image | Created tile|
| --- | --- |
| <img src=""https://github.com/jo-mueller/napari-boardgame-maker/raw/main/docs/imgs/sample.png""> | <img src=""https://github.com/jo-mueller/napari-boardgame-maker/raw/main/docs/imgs/sample_as_tile.png""> |

## Data

In principle, all 2D grayscale image data can be used to create a tile. However, using digital elevation models is particularly cool. Such data is publicly available at [OpenTopography.org](https://portal.opentopography.org/raster?opentopoID=OTSDEM.032021.4326.2). Acknowledgement:

```
## Usage

To use the boardgame tile maker, open it from the plugins menu (`Plugins > napari-boardgame-maker: Boardgame Tile Maker`) or from the tools menu (`Tools > Boardgame tile maker (npbgm)`). There are a few steps and parameters to set before the tile can be created.

[](https://github.com/jo-mueller/napari-boardgame-maker/raw/main/docs/imgs/GUI_screenshot.jpg)

Clicking on `Make hexagon` and `Make number field` will create a hexagonal shape in the viewer (which will be the outline of the tile) and a circular field (which can later be used to put some markers, figures, chips, etc. On the center of the board).

![](https://github.com/jo-mueller/napari-boardgame-maker/raw/main/docs/imgs/sample_with_shapes.png)

The next step is to set the parameters for the tile. The following parameters can be set:

### Radii and sizes

The following sketch shows the different radii and sizes that can be set:

![](https://github.com/jo-mueller/napari-boardgame-maker/raw/main/docs/imgs/stride_and_town.png)

- `hexagon radius`: The radius of the hexagon (in pixels). Upon export, this will be rescaled to a desired physical size in mm.
- `number field radius`: The radius of the number field (in pixels). Can also be set in mm units. The pixels are changed accordingly if the size of the whole hexagon is changed.
- `stride`: The region next to the edge of the tile that should remain flat.
- `town radius`: A circular region around the edges of the hexagonal tiles that should remain flat.

### Topography

The following parameters can be set to create the topography of the tile:

![](https://github.com/jo-mueller/napari-boardgame-maker/raw/main/docs/imgs/slope_and_heights.png)

- `slope`: Adds a smooth transition of a given width between the edge of the cropped topography and the level of the base platte. Setting this to zero will result in a sharp edge.
- `z-multiplier`: The height of the topography is multiplied by this factor. This can be used to scale the topography to the desired height.
- `Plate thickness`: The thickness of the base plate (in mm).

### Export

- CLicking on `produce tile` will run the workflow to create the tile
- Clicking `Export` will open a dialog to save the tile as an `.stl` file. *Note*: The tile will be exported in the size of the hexagon radius. If the hexagon radius is set to 100 mm, the tile will be exported as a 100 mm hexagon.

## Introduction

`napari-bootstrapper` is a tool to quickly generate dense 3D labels using sparse 2D labels within napari.

Dense 3D segmentations are generated using the 2D->3D method described in the preprint titled [_Sparse Annotation is Sufficient for Bootstrapping Dense Segmentation_](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.06.14.599135v2). In the preprint, we show sparse 2D annotations made in ~10 minutes on a single section can generate dense 3D segmentations that are reasonably good starting points for refining or bootstrapping.

This plugin is limited to the 2D->3D method and is intended for small volumes that can fit in memory. For more complex bootstrapping workflows, dedicated 3D models, and block-wise processing of large volumes, we recommend using the [_Bootstrapper_](https://github.com/ucsdmanorlab/bootstrapper) CLI tool.

## Installation

We recommend installing `napari-bootstrapper` via conda and [pip]:

1. Create a new environment called `napari-bootstrapper`:

```bash
conda create -n napari-bootstrapper -c conda-forge python==3.11 napari pyqt
```

2. Activate the newly-created environment:

```
conda activate napari-bootstrapper
```

3. You can install `napari-bootstrapper` via [pip]:

```bash
pip install napari-bootstrapper
```
   - Or you can install the latest development version from github:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/ucsdmanorlab/napari-bootstrapper.git
```


## Getting Started
Run the following in your terminal:
```bash
conda activate napari-bootstrapper
napari
```

This is a system that combines optical validation of model predictions by having different 3D visualizations and quantitative evaluation. Utilizing Blender’s rendering capabilities for deepening the understanding of nuclei segmentation for users with different levels of expertise. Examples are time-lapse animations (aimed to be generated from label data), opaque ground truth visualizations with solid prediction objects to compare prediction quality optically and 3D images where nuclei are coloured according to their prediction quality. To facilitate meaningful quantitative evaluation, different metrics are calculated for these predictions and displayed within the animation, such as the Jaccard index, Intersection over Union and the F1-score. The emphasis in this system is on operating it with limited technical knowledge, allowing for bridging between researchers and developers; but includes metrics that allow for a deeper understanding of performance for expert users.

Explore image in channel coordinate spaces.


**Original motivation**: Brainbow dataset have unique features that need to be addressed by specialized tools.
This plugin allows you to visualize the distribution of the channel ratio interactively in the image space and channel spaces.

You can also use this plugin along with the [`napari-cluster-plotter` plugin](https://github.com/BiAPoL/napari-clusters-plotter?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) to interact with individual objects.

![demo_gif](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LaboratoryOpticsBiosciences/napari-brainbow-diagnose/main/docs/demo_napari-brainbow-diagnose.gif)

## Available Channel space transformation

The following channel spaces are available:

![image|width=10](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0dae9090-da16-4653-b466-a08289e061ea)


From Cartesian RGB:
- (a) Maxwell triangle (ternary plot) [illustration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ternary_plot)
- (c) Hue-Saturation wheel [illustration (g)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hsl-hsv_models.svg)
- (e) Spherical coordinates (Theta, Phi and Radius) [illustration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_coordinate_system)
- (g,i) Hue-Saturation-Value planes [illustration (b)(f)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Hsl-hsv_models.svg)

## Example Notebooks

You can use this plugin to visualize channel space of:
- interactively every voxel in the image (see [demo notebook](docs/demo.ipynb))
- interactively every object (aka center point) in the image (see [demo notebook](docs/cluster_plotter_compatibility.ipynb)). To use this notebook you need to install [`napari-cluster-plotter` plugin](https://github.com/BiAPoL/napari-clusters-plotter?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).
- Not interactive in matplotlib to export figures: (see [demo notebook](docs/plot_color_space_matplotlib.ipynb))

## Example Datasets

If you want to use your dataset, you have to format it such as each channel is in one distinct `napari.Layers`
You can open test dataset to try this plugin in `File > Open Sample > napari-brainbow-diagnose`.

- The RGB Cube is an array with shape (3x256x256x256) cube : Great to check how the plugin work when all color are represented
- ChroMS Cortex Sample is an array with shape (3x256x256x256) #Hugo : Real life brainbow image (Cortex E18 Emx1Cre) !

Once you have your layers you can use the dropdown and select the corresponding layer. It is advised to match the `red, green, blue` order so the ratio you see on the napari viewer corresponds to the Hue-Saturation Wheel of the plugin.

## Installation

You can install `napari-brainbow-diagnose` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-brainbow-diagnose

If you want to use [`napari-cluster-plotter` plugin](https://github.com/BiAPoL/napari-clusters-plotter?tab=readme-ov-file#installation)  you also need to install it manually

To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/LaboratoryOpticsBiosciences/napari-brainbow-diagnose.git

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

----------------------------------

The plugin provides a widget which can load, preprocess, annotate and export cardio biosensor data.  

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/stable/plugins/index.html
-->

## Installation

You can install `napari-cardio-bio-eval` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-cardio-bio-eval

Or use the Napari plugin manager and search for `napari-cardio-bio-eval`.

<!--
First install a fresh conda enviroment (or other python enviroment) and activate it:

    conda create -y -n napari-env -c conda-forge python=3.10
    conda activate napari-env

Then you can pip install the plugin from the github repository and it will also downloads the necessary packages:

    pip install git+https://github.com/Nanobiosensorics/napari-cardio-bio-eval

Then you can start napari with a simple command:

    napari
-->
# Usage

You can open the plugin's widgets from the **Plugins** menu after the installation of the plugin.

![image](https://github.com/Nanobiosensorics/napari-cardio-bio-eval/assets/78443646/5d209fb5-c921-45d6-bb63-c5e3ff1fb1f8)

## Data loading and preprocessing

At the top of the widget, you need to select the directory, which contains the data you want to examine and process. To successfully load the data the directory have to contain the following files:
- *_wl_power.file: which contains the starting values of the measurement
- DRM directory: which contains the difference from the previous measurement point 
- *_avg.file: which contains additional biosensor data

#### Import parameters:  
- Flipping: horizontal and vertical mirroring of the biosensor recording
- Signal range type: with this you can choose how do you want to select a smaller range of the measurement in the next field *Ranges*
    - measurement phase: you can give the index of the phases you want to see, for example with 0-1 you can view the measurement from the start to the first pause
    - individual point: you can select any given frames in an interval, for example with selecting 34 and 275 you can view the measurement from frame 34 to frame 275
- Ranges: if you choose measurement phase then give the range of the phases you want to see and if you choose individual point then select the starting and end frames. The label above helps as it shows the phrases (except the last one) and the full time of the measurement. The minimum frame or phase must be smaller than the maximum.
- Drift correction threshold: Ranges between 25 and 500.
- Filter method: mean or median

![image](https://github.com/Nanobiosensorics/napari-cardio-bio-eval/assets/78443646/28b5f563-1c5e-4591-bdf6-2ece936becac)

![image](https://github.com/Nanobiosensorics/napari-cardio-bio-eval/assets/78443646/a6004667-deac-4ff8-8729-0fcb8bc35f7f)

After selecting the source directory and the optional fliping you can load in the data with the ***Load Data*** button. After the raw data is loaded you can select the slice of the measurement you want to work with and some other parameters. Then by clicking the ***Preprocess Data*** button you start the processing and after a few seconds the well images will appear on the viewer.  

![image](https://github.com/Nanobiosensorics/napari-cardio-bio-eval/assets/78443646/23e38c70-d058-41cc-9e9e-f2d34ea553e0)

Each well has its own layer. You can turn the layers visible or invisible by clicking the small eye icon on each layer.

If the selected range is not what you wanted then you can change the parameters and preprocess again. But if you moved on to the next step (manual background selection or peak detection) then you need to restart Napari to load other data or preprocess with different parameters.

After you see the wells you can proceed to the next step or if the automatic background correction is not good enough you can click the ***Select Background Points Manually*** button and it will show the automatically selected background points for each well, which you can move to better background coordinates and in the next peak detection step these points will be used by the background correction algorithm. After the first export these points will be saved so if the same directory is loaded a second time the preprocessing will use these points.

During the background selection do NOT delete any layers.

![image](https://github.com/Nanobiosensorics/napari-cardio-bio-eval/assets/78443646/133fd74a-b53b-4540-bdf9-209c325e2b4b)

## Selecting the cells

In this step you can also set some parameters for the peak detection algorithm and then click the ***Detect Signal Peaks*** button to start the process. After a few seconds the wells with the potential cells will show on the window.

#### Detection parameters:  
- Threshold range: 25-5000
- Neighbourhood size: 1-10
- Error mask filtering:

![image](https://github.com/Nanobiosensorics/napari-cardio-bio-eval/assets/78443646/842ad2e3-32dd-4d6c-8e98-47c137a7029b)

Here you can delete, add or move the points on each points layer. There are keyboard shortcuts for easier use! 
Additionally by double clicking on any point of the image you can examine the time-signal diagram of the selected point under the widget. Be sure to select the correct layer!  

If you do not need any of the wells, then you can delete the layer and it won't be exported. If you either delete an image or peak points layer belonging to a well, the well will not be included in the export!  
After selecting the needed cells and wells (and deleting the unnecessary ones) you can export plots and additional information about them.

## Exporting

You can select what kind of data do you want to export and click the ***Export Data*** button. The data will be exported to the source directory into a *result* sub-directory.

#### Export options:
- Coordinates: the coordinates of the selected cells
- Preprocessed signals: 
- Raw signals:
- Average signal: 
- Breakdown signal: 
- Max well: 
- Plot signals with well:  
- Plot well with coordinates: 
- Plot cells individually: 
- Signal parts by phases: 
- Max centered signals: 

## Segmentation widget

The data loading and preprocessing is the same but it uses a deep learning model to segment the cells.

Napari-Buds is a random forest based mother-bud annotation plugin for Napari devevoped by the TutucciLab (https://www.tutuccilab.com/) of the systems biology group at the Vrije Universiteit van Amsterdam. Mother-bud annotation requires single or multichannel 2D images of budding yeast and a fluorescent marker that localizes to the bud. In the example dataset provided smFISH DNA-probes were used as localized bud marker.The GUI layout for random forest based classification was inspired by ImageJ 'plugin Weka Segmentation' [1]. **Before installation make sure you have a working version of napari installed (pip install ""napari[all]"").** Napari-Buds is a random forest based mother-bud annotation plugin for Napari developed by the TutucciLab (https://www.tutuccilab.com/) of the systems biology group at the Vrije Universiteit van Amsterdam. Mother-bud annotation requires single or multichannel 2D images of budding yeast and a fluorescent marker that localizes to the bud. In the example dataset provided smFISH DNA-probes were used as localized bud marker.The GUI layout for random forest based classification was inspired by ImageJ 'plugin Weka Segmentation' [1]. 

Please follow the workflow described underneath to perform mother-bud annotation:

1. Open images in napari and create empty label layer.
For multichannel images each channel should be provided seperately to napari.
An example (jupyter) notebook (Open Test Images Napari.ipynb) for loading test data in napari is provided in the notebooks folder. 
Example dataset can be downloaded from https://zenodo.org/record/7004556#.YwM1_HZBztU. 
    
2. If multichannel images are unaligned the  translate widget under Plugins>napari-buds>Translate can be used. 
Select which layer should be translated to align to the layers in widget menu. Then use the aswd keys to translate (move) the selected layer. 
To register changes and update coordinates of the translated image in napari press t. 
    
### Random forest classification
3. To open the mother-bud annotation plugin go to Plugins>napari-buds>bud annotation.
    
4. To train a random forest classifier, in the created label layer draw examples of cells, buds and background (see tutorial gif below). 
In the Define Label segment of the widget you define which label value (class #label_value) corresponds to cells, buds and background. 
Currently, cells and backgrounds and buds **have to be defined in the Define Label segment**  if you want to be able to segment the classification as well.
In the segment **Layers to extract Features from** we can select which layers will be used in training the random forest classifier. 
Next press **Train classifier**. After training is completed a result layer is added to layer list. 
Inspect the results carefully to asses classifier performance. The trained classifier can be saved using the **save classifier** button.
Previously trained classifier can be loaded by pressing **Load classifier**. Loaded classifier can applied to new images by pressing **Classify**, resulting again in a results layer.
It is possible to change the random forest parameters with **the Set random forest parameters** button and changing the values in the pop up menu.
Press **Run** to register changed settings. For an example of the parameters used see: 
https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html and 
https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/segmentation/plot_trainable_segmentation.html. 
    
5. Next, we want to perfom watershed segmentation using the result layer. However, for watershed segmentation seeds (also called markers) are required
(for an explanation of watershed segmenation see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watershed_(image_processing)). 
To define the seeds we can either simply threshold on one of the supplied image layers or we can use distance tranform (https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/segmentation/plot_watershed.html#sphx-glr-auto   examples-segmentation-plot-watershed-py).The resulting seeds layer can be adjusted manually by editing in napari.
A good seeds layers correspond to each cell having a single seed (buds are not single cells). To perform watershed segmentation press the **Segment** button.
    
6. Carefully inspect the resulting cell mask and bud layer. Correct the mistakes in both layers. 
Bud label values should correspond to the label value of the cell mask of mother cell. To verify mother bud relations were drawn correctly
press **Draw Mother-Bud relations**. If Mother-Bud relations are correct, you can save both label layers. Mother and buds simply share the same label number.
Thus, either the mother or bud layer can be manually corrected for mistakes. Corrections can be checked by clicking **Draw Mother-Bud relations** again. 
mother and buds layer can be saved manually in napari. When using Jupyter notebook mother and bud layers can be saved as shown in Open Test Images Napari.ipynb.

7. An example notebook for dataextraction of the created cell and bud masks can be found in the example notebooks folder (Extract_Mother_Buds_relations_from_Masks_and_intergrate_FQ_spot_data.ipynb).This notebooks relates RNA spots (smFISH data found on zenodo) to the mother or bud compartment.

## Installation
### Local Installation

To install `napari-clemreg` it is recommended to create a fresh [conda] environment with Python 3.9:

```
conda create -n clemreg_env python=3.9
```
Next, install `napari` with the following command via [pip]: 

```
pip install ""napari[all]""
```

Finally, `napari-clemreg` can be installed with:
```
pip install napari-clemreg
```
When installing `napari-clemreg` on a Windows machine, the following error might appear:
```
error Microsoft Visual C++ 14.0 is required
```
Ensure that [Visual Studios C++ 14.00](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=BuildTools&rel=16) is installed

### Docker Container
If you would like to run `napari-clemreg` in a docker container instead of installing it as above, please follow the instructions in our [Docker guide](docker_guide.md)

## Usage
CLEM-reg is the combination of 5 main steps, MitoNet segmentation, LoG segmentation,
point cloud sampling, point cloud registration and lastly image warping. These 5 steps 
can be run all at once using the run registration widget shown below with the tick next to it.
Alternatively, they can be run individually with the numbered widgets.

![clemreg_widget_options.png](docs%2Fimages%2Fclemreg_widget_options.png)

### Run Registration



![registration_labels.png](docs%2Fimages%2FCLEMreg-fig.png)

1. **Moving Image** - Here you select your light microscopy (LM) data which will
be warped to align with the fixed electron microscopy (EM) image.
2. **Fixed Image** - Here you select your EM data which will
act as the reference point for the LM to be aligned to.
3. **Registration Algorithm** - Here you can decide which type of registration algorith
will be used for the registration of inputted LM and EM. In terms of speed of each algorithm
the following is the generally true, Rigid CPD > Affine CPD > BCPD.
4. **MitoNet Segmentation Parameters** - Here are the advanced options for the segmentation
of the mitochondria in the EM data.
   1. Prediction Across Three Axis - By selecting this option MitoNet will run segmentation
across all three axis of the EM volume and then these three predictions will be aggregate.
5. **LoG Segmentation Parameters** - Here are the advanced options for the segmentation of 
the mitochondria in the LM data.
   1. Sigma - Sigma value for the Laplacian of Gaussian filter.
   2. Threshold - Threshold value for the segmenting the LM data.
6. **Point Cloud Sampling** - Here are the advanced options for the point cloud sampling of the 
segmentations of the LM and EM data.
   1. Sampling Frequency - Frequency of point sampling from the fixed and moving segmentation. The greater the value the more points in the point cloud.
   2. Sigma - Sigma value for the canny edge filter.
7. **Point Cloud Registration** - Here are the advanced options for the registration of the point clouds
of both the LM and EM data.
   1. Voxel Size - The size voxel size of each point. Smaller the size the less memory consumption.
   2. Subsampling - Downsampling of the point clouds to reduce memory consumption. Greater the number the fewer points in the point cloud.
   3. Maximum Iterations - The number of round of point cloud registration. If too small it won't converge on an opitmal registration.
8. **Image Warping** - Here are the advanced options for the image warping of the moving LM images.
   1. Interpolation Order - The order of the spline interpolation.
   2. Aproximate Grid - Controls the ""resolution"" of the grid onto which you're warping. A higher value reduces the step size between coordinates.
   3. Sub-division Factor - Controls the size of the chunk when applying the warping.
9. **Save Parameters** - Here you can select the option to save the advanced options you've selected
to a JSON file which can be kept for reproducibility as well as running the registration again.
10. **Visualise Intermediate Results** - Here you can select to view the outputs of each step as they
are completed.

### Split Registration
As well as being able to run all the steps of CLEM-reg in one widget (the `Run registration` widget),
you are also able to do all these steps independently using the `Split Registration` functionality. 

There are four separate widgets that encapsulate the 5 steps of CLEM-reg each of which have
their own unique input and output:
1. `MitoNet Segmentation` 
   - **Input**: EM Image
   - **Output**: EM Segmentation
2. `LoG Segmentation`
   - **Input**: LM Image
   - **Output**: LM Segmentation
3. `Point Cloud Sampling`
   - **Input**: LM Segmentation & EM Segmentation
   - **Output**: LM Point Cloud & LM Point Cloud
4. `Point Cloud Registration & Image Warping`
   - **Input**: EM Image, LM Image, LM Point Cloud & EM Point Cloud
   - **Output**: Registered LM Image, Registered LM Point Cloud

### Registering Multiple LM Channels
One can register multiple LM channels at once by doing the following.

1. Start by splitting the LM channels into the separate layers by right-clicking on
the layer and then selecting `Split Stack`.
![merged-channel-split-options.png](docs%2Fimages%2Fmerged-channel-split-options.png)
This will result in each of the channels having their own individual layer. 

2. Once this is done we must link all the LM layers together, this is done 
by selecting all the layers which will highlight them in blue, once again right-clicking
on the layer and then selecting `Link Layers.`
![split-channels-link-layers.png](docs%2Fimages%2Fsplit-channels-link-layers.png)

3. When you finally go to run CLEM-reg ensure that for the `Moving Image`
you select the LM layer that contains mitochondria.

## Installation

You can install `napari-caphid` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-caphid



To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/hereariim/napari-caphid.git

## Getting started

### Foreword

Before using the plugin, the directory must be structured as follows:

```
└── Directory
    ├── France
    │   ├── image
    │   │   ├── img_1.tif
    │   │   ├── img_2.tif
    │   │   ...
    │   │   └── img_n.tif
    │   ├── mask
    │   │   ├── msk_1.tif
    │   │   ├── msk_2.tif
    │   │   ...
    │   │   └── msk_n.tif
    │   ├── img_1.tif
    │   ├── msk_1.tif
    │   ├── img_2.tif
    │   ├── msk_2.tif
    │   ...
    │   ├── img_n.tif
    │   └── msk_n.tif
    │ 
    ├── Belgium
    │   ├── image
    │   │   └── ...
    │   ├── mask
    │   │   └── ...
    │   └── ...
    ├── Spain
    │   ├── image
    │   │   └── ...
    │   ├── mask
    │   │   └── ...
    │   └── ...
    └── Aphid.csv
```

Some explanation about structure. The directory contained three folders (France, Spain, Belgium) and one file (Aphid.csv).
- Each folders (France, Spain, Belgium) contains a set of images and masks and two folders (image, mask). The folder image contains images from the set of images. The folder mask contains masks from the set of masks.
- The file Aphid.csv is a table with quantitative data of aphids from inital process of aphid image processing.

Important:
- The structure of directory is very important because it will be useful to get image name.

### Getting started

The widget get three input:
- Mask : Mask stack
- Pick a table : Path/to/Directory/Aphid.csv
- Country : The country where images were taken

The widget gives one output:
- A new table .csv which is the Aphid.csv updated.

### What's it for ?

This widget gives quantitative data from Mask stack. These quantitative data will be contained into dataframe. Quantitative data linked to current masks contained in the Aphid.csv file will be deleted. Then, the new quantitative data contained in the dataframe will be integrated into the Aphid.csv file. In this way, the Aphid.csv file is updated.

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/docs/plugins/index.html
-->

## Installation

You can install `napari-ccp4map` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-ccp4map

## Usage
If the plugin was installed correctly, it will pop up in a napari window under Plugins->Install/Uninstall Plugins.
You can either drag&drop filed into the window to read them, or search for a folder/file using Ctrl+O.

## How it works
This plugin simply reads a file and allows [gemmi](https://github.com/project-gemmi/gemmi) to interact with it. Then, numpy turns the file into an array.

**A package for 3D cell segmentation with deep learning, including a napari plugin**: training, inference, and data review. In particular, this project was developed for analysis of confocal and mesoSPIM-acquired (cleared tissue + lightsheet) tissue datasets, but is not limited to this type of data. [Check out our preprint for more information!](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.17.594691v1)


![demo](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/57f6d51c9f74566f55ecf271/0d16a71b-3ff2-477a-9d83-18d96cb1ce28/full_demo.gif?format=500w)


## Installation

 💻 See the [Installation page](https://adaptivemotorcontrollab.github.io/CellSeg3D/welcome.html) in the documentation for detailed instructions.

## Documentation

📚 Documentation is available at [https://AdaptiveMotorControlLab.github.io/CellSeg3D
](https://adaptivemotorcontrollab.github.io/CellSeg3D/welcome.html)


📚 For additional examples and how to reproduce our paper figures, see: [https://github.com/C-Achard/cellseg3d-figures](https://github.com/C-Achard/cellseg3d-figures)

## Quick Start

```
pip install napari_cellseg3d
```

To use the plugin, please run:
```
napari
```
Then go into `Plugins > napari-cellseg3d`, and choose which tool to use.

- **Review (label)**: This module allows you to review your labels, from predictions or manual labeling, and correct them if needed. It then saves the status of each file in a csv, for easier monitoring.
- **Inference**: This module allows you to use pre-trained segmentation algorithms on volumes to automatically label cells and compute statistics.
- **Train**:  This module allows you to train segmentation algorithms from labeled volumes.
- **Utilities**: This module allows you to perform several actions like cropping your volumes and labels dynamically, by selecting a fixed size volume and moving it around the image; fragment images into smaller cubes for training; or converting labels from instance to segmentation and the opposite.

## Why use CellSeg3D?

The strength of our approach is we can match supervised model performance with purely self-supervised learning, meaning users don't need to spend (hundreds) of hours on annotation. Here is a quick look of our key results. TL;DR see panel **f**, which shows that with minmal input data we can outperform supervised models:

**b:** Evaluation of instance segmentation performance for baseline
thresholding-only, supervised models: Cellpose, StartDist, SwinUNetR, SegResNet, and our self-supervised model WNet3D over three data subsets.
F1-score is computed from the Intersection over Union (IoU) with ground truth labels, then averaged. Error bars represent 50% Confidence Intervals
(CIs).
**c:** View of 3D instance labels from supervised models, as noted, for visual cortex volume in b evaluation.

## Requirements

**Compatible with Python 3.8 to 3.10.**
Requires **[napari]**, **[PyTorch]** and **[MONAI]**.
Compatible with Windows, MacOS and Linux.
Installation should not take more than 30 minutes, depending on your internet connection.

For PyTorch, please see [the PyTorch website for installation instructions].

A CUDA-capable GPU is not needed but very strongly recommended, especially for training.

If you get errors from MONAI regarding missing readers, please see [MONAI's optional dependencies] page for instructions on getting the readers required by your images.

### Install note for ARM64 (Silicon) Mac users

To avoid issues when installing on the ARM64 architecture, please follow these steps.

1) Create a new conda env using the provided conda/napari_CellSeg3D_ARM64.yml file :

        git clone https://github.com/AdaptiveMotorControlLab/CellSeg3d.git
        cd CellSeg3d
        conda env create -f conda/napari_CellSeg3D_ARM64.yml
        conda activate napari_CellSeg3D_ARM64


2) Install a Qt backend (PySide or PyQt5)
3) Launch napari, the plugin should be available in the plugins menu.



## Issues

**Help us make the code better by reporting issues and adding your feature requests!**


If you encounter any problems, please [file an issue] along with a detailed description.

## Testing

You can generate docs locally by running ``make html`` in the docs/ folder.

Before testing, install all requirements using ``pip install napari-cellseg3d[test]``.

``pydensecrf`` is also required for testing.

To run tests locally:

- Locally : run ``pytest napari_cellseg3d\_tests`` in the plugin folder.
- Locally with coverage : In the plugin folder, run ``coverage run --source=napari_cellseg3d -m pytest`` then ``coverage xml`` to generate a .xml coverage file.
- With tox : run ``tox`` in the plugin folder (will simulate tests with several python and OS configs, requires substantial storage space)

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome.

Please ensure the coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request.

For local installation from Github cloning, please run:

```
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

1. `Plugins>start conference`
2. Check `running` checkbox
3. Press `Update` button to update any setting (and start/stop)

If things work in zoom but you don't show up, then make sure `blur
background` is disabled.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

You will need to:

- follow `pyvirtualcam`'s installation instructions:
https://github.com/letmaik/pyvirtualcam#installation
- install `napari` from source to get the new async slicing updates 

Note: I needed to install `pyvirtualcam` from source on my MacOS M1
with python=3.10.

This plugin is a use case for obtaining conidia and hyphae surface from images. This plugin is a private tool dedicated exclusively to the work of the QUASAV team.

## Installation

This private tool cannot be found in the built-in napari. The installation therefore follows two steps:

1 - Install latest development version :

    git clone https://github.com/hereariim/napari-conidie.git

## Getting started

As prerequisite, user must have installed ilastik in its computer.

Before using the plugin, you must have two data:

- The ilastik model
- The compressed file contained your images structured as followed :

```
└── Compressed file
    ├── Folder1
    │   ├── img0_1.jpg
    │   ├── img0_2.jpg
    │   ...
    │   └── img0_n.jpg
    │ 
    ├── Folder2
    │   ├── img1_1.jpg
    │   ├── img1_2.jpg
    │   ...
    │   └── img1_n.jpg
    ...
    │
    └──  Foldern

![interface.png](https://github.com/copick/napari-copick/raw/main/docs/assets/interface.png)

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/stable/plugins/index.html
-->

## Installation

You can install `napari-copick` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-copick

To install latest development version:

    pip install git+https://github.com/copick/napari-copick.git

## Usage

### Using a copick config file

```bash
napari-copick run --config path/to/copick_config.json
```

### Using dataset IDs from CZ cryoET Data Portal

```bash
napari-copick run --dataset-ids 10440 10441 --overlay-root /path/to/overlay_root
```

You can specify multiple dataset IDs separated by spaces.

### GUI Usage

The plugin provides an intuitive interface with two loading options:

1. **Load Config File**: Opens a file dialog to select a copick configuration JSON file
2. **Load from Dataset IDs**: Opens a dialog to enter CZ cryoET Data Portal dataset IDs and overlay root path

After loading, you'll see a hierarchical tree of the project structure that you can navigate to access tomograms, segmentations, and picks.

### Tomogram Handling

napari-copick now handles multiscale zarr arrays directly:

- Automatically detects and loads all available resolution levels
- Creates a proper multiscale image stack using napari's native multiscale API
- Uses dask for efficient lazy loading of large tomogram data
- Applies appropriate scaling factors based on the voxel size metadata

This direct zarr handling provides better performance and more flexibility compared to relying on external plugins.

A plugin that adds a console to napari

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using with [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/docs/plugins/index.html
-->

## Local variables

In napari-console 0.0.8 and earlier, the console `locals()` namespace only
contained a reference to the napari viewer that enclosed the console.

Since version 0.0.9, it instead contains everything in the enclosing frame that
called napari. That is, if your Python code is:

```python
import napari
import numpy as np
from scipy import ndimage as ndi

image = np.random.random((500, 500))
labels = ndi.label(image > 0.7)[0]

viewer, image_layer = napari.imshow(image)
labels_layer = viewer.add_labels(labels)

napari.run()
```

Then the napari console will have the variables `np`, `napari`, `ndi`, `image`,
`labels`, `viewer`, `image_layer`, and `labels_layer` in its namespace.

This is implemented by inspecting the Python stack when the console is first
instantiated, finding the first frame that is outside of the `napari_console`,
`napari`, and `in_n_out` modules, and passing the variables in the frame's
`f_locals` and `f_globals` to the console namespace.

If you want to disable this behavior (for example, because you are embedding
napari and the console within some larger application), you can add
`NAPARI_EMBED=1` to your environment variables before instantiating the
console.

## Installation

You can install `napari-console` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-console

## Description

This napari plugin provides readers and writers for labels and their corresponding image layers into zarr format for compression and portability. Each reader/writer pair supports a round trip of saving and loading image and labels layers.

## Writers
Two writers are provided by this plugin, each with its own reader.

### `labels_to_zarr`
This writer is an alternative to napari's default label writer and will write an entire labels layer, regardless of its dimensions, into a single zarr file. This writer provides the best compression option and its associated reader `get_zarr_labels` will read the layer back into napari.

This writer will be called when the user tries to save a selected labels layer into a path ending with .zarr

### `label_image_pairs_to_zarr`
This writer will save 3-dimensional labels and image layers from the viewer into individual zarrs for portability and convenience. For example, given one labels and one image layer of the shape (10, 200, 200) saved to my_stacks.zarr, 10 subdirectories will be created, each with two zarrs inside of shape (200, 200) corresponding to the labels and image layer.

This writer allows users to load stacks of associated images, label them, and then quickly save these stacks out into individual slices for easy loading, viewing and interaction. Its associated reader supports the loading into napari of the whole stack, all layers at one slice of the stack, and an individual layer of a given slice of the stack.

The writer currently supports only 3D layers, with the exception of RGB images of the form (z, y, x, 3), which are also supported.


## Readers

Two readers are provided by this plugin for loading the formats saved by each writer. These are detailed below.

### `get_zarr_labels`

This reader will open any zarr file with a .zarray at the top level in `path` as a labels layer. This is to be used in conjunction with `labels_to_zarr`.


### `get_label_image_stack`

This reader will open any zarr containing a `.zmeta` file as layers into napari. Depending on what is being opened, the reader will either load a full stack of labels and images, one slice of a stack of images and labels or an individual layer within a slice. This is to be used in conjunction with `label_image_pairs_to_zarr`.

## .zmeta

This metadata file contains information about the layer types in the stack and in each individual slice, as well as the number of image/label slices. This allows the reader plugin to load the correct layer types with appropriate names both at a stack level and at the individual slice level.

### An example .zmeta specification

```json
{
    ""meta"": {
        ""stack"": 7                               # number of slices in the entire stack (1 for an individual slice, 0 for a layer within a slice)
    },
    ""data"": {
        ""image"" : [                              # all image layers must be listed here
            {
                ""name"": ""leaves_example_data"",
                ""shape"": [790, 790, 3],
                ""dtype"": ""uint8"",
                ""rgb"": true                      # where rgb is false the image will be loaded as greyscale (colormap support has not yet been implemented)
            }
        ],
        ""labels"" : [
            {
                ""name"": ""oak"",
                ""shape"": [790, 790],
                ""dtype"": ""int64""
            },
            {
                ""name"": ""bg"",
                ""shape"": [790, 790],
                ""dtype"": ""int64""
            }
        ]
    }
}

![overview conv-paint](/images/overview_github.png)
This napari plugin can be used to segment objects or structures in images based on a few brush strokes providing examples of the classes. Based on the same idea as other tools like ilastik, its main strength is that it can use features from pretrained neural networks like VGG16 or DINOV2, enabling the segmentation of more complex images.

**Find more information and tutorials in the [docs](https://guiwitz.github.io/napari-convpaint/) or read the [preprint](https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.09.12.610926).**


![overview conv-paint](/images/network_github.png)

## Installation

You can install `napari-convpaint` via [pip]

    pip install napari-convpaint

To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/guiwitz/napari-convpaint.git


## Example use case: Tracking shark body parts in a movie
These are the scribble annotations provided for training:
![](./images/shark_annot.png)

And this is the resulting Convpaint segmentation:
<video src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6a2be1fe-25cc-4af1-9f50-aab9bc4123d9""></video>

Check out the documentation or the paper for more usecases!

## API

You can now use the API in a fashion very similar to the napari plugin. The ConvpaintModel class combines a feature extractor and a classifier model, and holds all the parameters defining the model. Initialize a ConvpaintModel object, train its classifier and use it to segment an image:

```Python
cp_model = ConvpaintModel(""dino"") # alternatively use vgg, cellpose or gaussian
cp_model.train(image, annotations)
segmentation = cp_model.segment(image)
```

There are many other options, such as predicting all class probabilities (see below) and we will update the documentation and notebook examples soon. In the meantime feel free to test it yourself.

```Python
probas = cp_model.predict_probas(image)
```

## Authors

The idea behind this napari plugin was first developed by [Lucien Hinderling](https://hinderling.github.io) in the group of [Olivier Pertz](https://www.pertzlab.net/), at the Institute of Cell Biology, University of Bern. Pertz lab obtained a CZI napari plugin development grant with the title [""Democratizing Image Analysis with an Easy-to-Train Classifier""](https://chanzuckerberg.com/science/programs-resources/imaging/napari/democratizing-image-analysis-with-an-easy-to-train-classifier/) which supported the adaptation of the initial concept as a napari plugin called napari-convpaint. The plugin has been developed by [Guillaume Witz<sup>1</sup>](https://guiwitz.github.io/blog/about/), [Roman Schwob<sup>1,2</sup>](https://github.com/quasar1357) and Lucien Hinderling<sup>2</sup> with much appreciated assistance of [Benjamin Grädel<sup>2</sup>](https://x.com/benigraedel), [Maciej Dobrzyński<sup>2</sup>](https://macdobry.net), Mykhailo Vladymyrov<sup>1</sup> and Ana Stojiljković<sup>1</sup>.

List and open tomograms from the CZ Imaging Institute's [CryoET Data Portal] in [napari].

![Plugin showing tomogram TS_043](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/napari-cryoet-data-portal/assets/2608297/61427a1f-df88-4e12-a680-32b8a10b6e6b)

## Installation

You can install the latest stable version using [pip]:

    pip install napari-cryoet-data-portal

You will also need to install napari separately as a Python package in the same environment.
One way to do that with Qt included is to run:

    pip install ""napari[all]""

but more generally you should follow the [latest napari installation instructions].

## Usage

See the following video for a demonstration of basic usage of the plugin.

https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/napari-cryoet-data-portal/assets/2608297/51207e08-68af-446a-87bb-3de9c6756d35

Click the *Connect* button to establish a connection to the data portal.

![Connect button and URL to the portal](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/napari-cryoet-data-portal/assets/2608297/acefbbe8-855a-490b-be44-45a003069b08)

You can optionally query a subset of datasets, runs, voxel spacings, or tomograms using their corresponding IDs.
This can speed up the listing process as the portal grows.
To do so, select an ID type in the associated drop-down box from this panel, then enter the IDs of interest separated by commas in the text box next to it.
For example, if you only want to list datasets 10000 and 10001, select *Dataset IDs* from the drop-down box and enter the text *10000,10001* in the text box.
By default, all datasets are listed.

After connecting to the portal, datasets are added below as they are found.

![Datasets and tomograms in the portal shown as an interactive tree](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/napari-cryoet-data-portal/assets/2608297/7af78e00-bbba-4c5b-a286-fb865ca8cff0)

Datasets and tomograms can be filtered by specifying a regular expression pattern.

![Datasets and tomograms filtered by the text 26, so that only two are shown](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/napari-cryoet-data-portal/assets/2608297/96a57f4c-290e-4932-aa2d-95d13edd2d8c)

Selecting a dataset displays its metadata, which can be similarly explored and filtered.

![Metadata of dataset 10000 shown as an interactive tree of keys and values](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/napari-cryoet-data-portal/assets/2608297/b230720a-9083-4e35-a9db-44071c979fcc)

Selecting a tomogram displays its metadata and also opens the lowest resolution tomogram and all of its associated point annotations in the napari viewer.

![Metadata of tomogram TS_026 shown as an interactive tree of keys and values](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/napari-cryoet-data-portal/assets/2608297/386b3116-ba16-4f5d-840d-4eafa3dc62b0)

Higher resolution tomograms can be loaded instead by selecting a different resolution and clicking the *Open* button.

![Open button and resolution selector showing high resolution](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/napari-cryoet-data-portal/assets/2608297/d84c93b2-e6e7-43ee-aeb9-acd1a314637e)

In this case, napari only loads the data that needs to be displayed in the canvas.
While this can reduce the amount of data loaded, it may also cause performance problems when initially opening and exploring the data.
By default, opening a new tomogram clears all the existing layers in napari.
If instead you want to keep those layers, uncheck the associated check-box in this panel.

In general, finding and fetching data from the portal can take a long time.
All plugin operations that fetch data from the portal try to run concurrently in order to keep interaction with napari and the plugin as responsive as possible.
These operations can also be cancelled by clicking the *Cancel* button.

![Progress bar with loading status and cancel button](https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/napari-cryoet-data-portal/assets/2608297/2dc316ae-5231-4159-bc93-785548dbf6a5)

-->

## Installation

You can install `napari-cursor-tracker` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-cursor-tracker

## Getting Started with napari-cursor-tracker

Welcome to `napari-cursor-tracker`, a tool that simplifies the annotation of points in stacks of images by tracking your cursor's position. This documentation will guide you through the process of setting up and using this plugin effectively.

### Points Layer Setup

Before you can start tracking, you need to create a points layer, which will store the positions of your cursor for each image in the stack. Here's how to set it up:

1. **Choose a Reference Image:** Start by selecting a ""Reference image"" from your image stack. The number of frames or slices in the reference image determines how many points your new layer will have (one per frame/slice).

2. **Specify Point Name:** Assign a name to the tracked point. This name will also serve as the name for the new layer. This step is particularly useful when tracking multiple points.

3. **Create the Layer:** Click on ""Add new layer"" to create the points layer. Initially, all points will be located at the origin (0, 0, 0), but their positions will be updated as you start tracking.

### Tracking Your Cursor

Now that you have set up the points layer, you can start tracking your cursor's position. Follow these steps:

1. **Select the Active Layer:** Choose the points layer where you want to save the tracking results as the ""Active layer.""

2. **Initiate Tracking:** Begin tracking your cursor's position by pressing the 't' key on your keyboard. To stop tracking, press 't' again. If the ""Auto play when tracking is started"" option is enabled, playback will start automatically when you press 't'. Alternatively, you can manually scroll through the images, and your cursor's position will be saved whenever the slice/frame index changes.

3. **Customize Playback:** To facilitate or expedite tracking, you can adjust playback parameters as needed.

### Tracking Multiple Points

If you need to track multiple points of interest, you can follow these steps:

1. **Create Individual Layers:** Create a separate points layer for each point you want to track.

2. **Select Active Layer:** Use the ""Active layer"" dropdown menu to select the specific points layer you want to work with.

3. **Start Tracking:** Begin tracking the selected point following the previously mentioned tracking process.

### Saving Your Results

The results from your tracking sessions can be saved as CSV files. Any points that were not tracked will be marked at the origin point (0, 0, 0) in the saved file.

With these guidelines, you should be well-prepared to efficiently annotate points in your image stacks using `napari-cursor-tracker`. Happy tracking!

Semantic Segmentation of multidimensional images using Deep Learning ONNX models packaged as *.czann files.

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

![Train on APEER and use model in Napari](https://github.com/sebi06/napari-czann-segment/raw/main/readme_images/Train_APEER_run_Napari_CZANN_no_highlights_small.gif)

## Installation

Before installing, please setup a conda environment. If you have never worked with conda environments, go through [this tutorial](https://biapol.github.io/blog/johannes_mueller/anaconda_getting_started/) first.

You can then install `napari-czann-segment` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-czann-segment

## What does the plugin do

The plugin allows you to:

- Use a *.czann file containing the Deep Neural Network (ONNX) for semantic segmentation and metadata
- Segmentation will be applied per 2D plane for all dimensions
- Processing larger multidimensional images it uses the [cztile] package to chunk the individual 2d arrays using a specific overlap.
- multidimensional images will be processed plane-by-plane

## What does the plugin NOT do

**Before one can actually use a model it needs to be trained, which is NOT done by this plugin**.

There are two main ways hwo such a model can be created:

- Train the segmentation model fully automated on [APEER] and download the *.czann file
- Train your model in a Jupyter notebook etc. and package it using the [czmodel] python package as an *.czann

## Using this plugin

### Sample Data

A test image and a *.czann model file can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/sebi06/napari-czann-segment/tree/main/src/napari_czann_segment/_data).

- `PGC_20X.ome.tiff` --> use `PGC_20X_nucleus_detector.czann` to segment

In order to use this plugin the user has to do the following things:

- Open the image using ""File - Open Files(s)"" (requires [napari-aicsimageio] plugin).
- Click **napari-czann-segment: Segment with CZANN model** in the ""Plugins"" menu.
- **Select a czann file** to use the model for segmentation.
- metadata of the model will be shown (see example below)

| Parameter    | Value                                        | Explanation                                             |
| :----------- | :------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| model_type   | ModelType.SINGLE_CLASS_SEMANTIC_SEGMENTATION | see: [czmodel] for details                              |
| input_shape  | [1024, 1024, 1]                              | tile dimensions of model input                          |
| output_shape | [1024, 1024, 3]                              | tile dimensions of model output                         |
| model_id     | ba32bc6d-6bc9-4774-8b47-20646c7cb838         | unique GUID for that model                              |
| min_overlap  | [128, 128]                                   | tile overlap used during training (for this model)      |
| classes      | ['background', 'grains', 'inclusions']       | available classes                                       |
| model_name   | APEER-trained model                          | name of the model                                       |

![Napari - Image loaded and czann selected](https://github.com/sebi06/napari-czann-segment/raw/main/readme_images/napari_czann1.png)

- Adjust the **minimum overlap** for the tiling (optional, see [cztile] for details).
- Select the **layer** to be segmented.
- Toggle **Use GPU for inference** checkbox to enable / disable using a GPU (Nvidia) for the segmentation (experimental feature).
- Press **Segment Selected Image Layer** to run the segmentation.

![Napari - Image successfully segmented](https://github.com/sebi06/napari-czann-segment/raw/main/readme_images/napari_czann3.png)

A successful is obviously only the starting point for further image analysis steps to extract the desired numbers from the segmented image.
Another example is shown below demonstrating a simple ""Grain Size Analysis"" using a deep-learning model trained on [APEER] used in [napari]

![Napari - Simple Grain Size Analysis](https://github.com/sebi06/napari-czann-segment/raw/main/readme_images/grainsize_czann_napari.png)

### Remarks

> **IMPORTANT**: Currently the plugin only supports using models trained on a **single channel** image. Therefore, make sure that during the training on [APEER] or somewhere else the correct inputs images are used.
> It is quite simple to train a single RGB image, which actually has three channels, load this image in [napari] and notice only then that the model will not work, because the image will 3 channels inside [napari].

- Only the CPU will be used for the inference using the ONNX runtime for the [ONNX-CPU] runtime
- GPUs are supported but require the [ONNX-GPU] runtime and the respective CUDA libraries.
- Please check the [YAML](env_napari_czann_segment.yml) for an example environment with GPU support.
- See also [pytorch] for instruction on how to install pytorch

## For developers

- **Please clone this repository first using your favorite tool.**

- **Ideally one creates a new [conda] environment or use an existing environment that already contains [Napari].**

Feel free to create a new environment using the [YAML](env_napari_czann_segment.yml) file at your own risk:

    cd the-github-repo-with-YAML-file
    conda env create --file conda_env_napari_czann_segment.yml
    conda activate napari_czmodel

- **Install the plugin locally**

Please run the following command:

    pip install -e .

To install latest development version:

    pip install git+https://github.com/sebi06/napari_czann_segment.git

A data inspection plugin for loading image tiles from multiple folders.
With data loading and prefetching handled automatically, file navigation is streamlined to enable fast and efficient data inspection.
Any number of folders for images and labels can be specified, and files are automatically paired based on their order — manual file selection is eliminated.
Perfect for high-throughput inspection workflows and rapid dataset review, especially in semantic segmentation tasks.

## Installation

```bash
# 1. Install napari if necessary
pip install napari[all]
# 2. Install the plugin
pip install napari-data-inspection
```

## Prerequisites

### Supported File Types
The following file types are supported: `.nii.gz`, `.png`, `.b2nd`, `.nrrd`, `.mha`, `.tif`, `.tiff`.
If you want to add custom ones add a loader to `src/napari_data_inspection/utils/data_loading.py`.

### Data Organization Requirements
Your data should be organized so that different images and different labels can be clearly distinguished—either by placing them in separate folders or by using consistent filename patterns (e.g., *_img for images and *_seg for labels).
**The number of files must match across all folders, as they are paired by order.**

## How to

```
napari -w napari-data-inspection
```

A napari plugin for keypoint annotation, also used within DeepLabCut!


## Installation

If you installed DeepLabCut[gui], this plugin is already installed. However, you can also use this as a stand-alone keypoint annotator without using DeepLabCut. Instructions below!

Start by installing PySide6 with `pip install ""pyside6==6.4.2""`; this is the library we now use to build GUIs.

You can then install `napari-deeplabcut` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-deeplabcut



Alternatively, to install the latest development version, run:

    pip install git+https://github.com/DeepLabCut/napari-deeplabcut.git


## Usage

To use the plugin, please run:

    napari

Then, activate the plugin in Plugins > napari-deeplabcut: Keypoint controls.

All accepted files (config.yaml, images, h5 data files) can be loaded
either by dropping them directly onto the canvas or via the File menu.

The easiest way to get started is to drop a folder (typically a folder from within a DeepLabCut's `labeled-data` directory), and, if labeling from scratch, drop the corresponding `config.yaml` to automatically add a `Points layer` and populate the dropdown menus.

[🎥 DEMO
](https://youtu.be/hsA9IB5r73E)

**Tools & shortcuts are:**

- `2` and `3`, to easily switch between labeling and selection mode
- `4`, to enable pan & zoom (which is achieved using the mouse wheel or finger scrolling on the Trackpad)
- `M`, to cycle through regular (sequential), quick, and cycle annotation mode (see the description [here](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/napari-deeplabcut/blob/5a5709dd38868341568d66eab548ae8abf37cd63/src/napari_deeplabcut/keypoints.py#L25-L34))
- `E`, to enable edge coloring (by default, if using this in refinement GUI mode, points with a confidence lower than 0.6 are marked
in red)
- `F`, to toggle between animal and body part color scheme.
- `V`, to toggle visibility of the selected layer.
- `backspace` to delete a point.
- Check the box ""display text"" to show the label names on the canvas.
- To move to another folder, be sure to save (`Ctrl+S`), then delete the layers, and re-drag/drop the next folder.
- One can jump to a specific image by double-clicking and editing the current frame number (located to the right of the slider).
- Selected points can be copied with `Ctrl+C`, and pasted onto other images with `Ctrl+V`.


### Save Layers

Annotations and segmentations are saved with `File > Save Selected Layer(s)...` (or its shortcut `Ctrl+S`).
Only when saving segmentation masks does a save file dialog pop up to name the destination folder;
keypoint annotations are otherwise automatically saved in the corresponding folder as `CollectedData_<ScorerName>.h5`.
- As a reminder, DLC will only use the H5 file; so be sure if you open already labeled images you save/overwrite the H5.
- Note, before saving a layer, make sure the points layer is selected. If the user clicked on the image(s) layer first, does `Save As`, then closes the window, any labeling work during that session will be lost!
- Modifying and then saving points in a `machinelabels...` layer will add to or overwrite the existing `CollectedData` layer and will **not** save to the `machinelabels` file.


### Video frame extraction and prediction refinement

Since v0.0.4, videos can be viewed in the GUI.

Since v0.0.5, trailing points can be visualized; e.g., helping in the identification
of swaps or outlier, jittery predictions.

Loading a video (and its corresponding output h5 file) will enable the video actions
at the top of the dock widget: they offer the option to manually extract video
frames from the GUI, or to define cropping coordinates.
Note that keypoints can be displaced and saved, as when annotating individual frames.


## Workflow

Suggested workflows, depending on the image folder contents:

1. **Labeling from scratch** – the image folder does not contain `CollectedData_<ScorerName>.h5` file.

    Open *napari* as described in [Usage](#usage) and open an image folder together with the DeepLabCut project's `config.yaml`.
    The image folder creates an *image layer* with the images to label.
    Supported image formats are: `jpg`, `jpeg`, `png`.
    The `config.yaml` file creates a *Points layer*, which holds metadata (such as keypoints read from the config file) necessary for labeling.
    Select the *Points layer* in the layer list (lower left pane on the GUI) and click on the *+*-symbol in the layer controls menu (upper left pane) to start labeling.
    The current keypoint can be viewed/selected in the keypoints dropdown menu (right pane).
    The slider below the displayed image (or the left/right arrow keys) allows selecting the image to label.

    To save the labeling progress refer to [Save Layers](#save-layers).
    `Data successfully saved` should be shown in the status bar, and the image folder should now contain a `CollectedData_<ScorerName>.h5` file.
    (Note: For convenience, a CSV file with the same name is also saved.)

2. **Resuming labeling** – the image folder contains a `CollectedData_<ScorerName>.h5` file.

    Open *napari* and open an image folder (which needs to contain a `CollectedData_<ScorerName>.h5` file).
    In this case, it is not necessary to open the DLC project's `config.yaml` file, as all necessary metadata is read from the `h5` data file.

    Saving works as described in *1*.

    ***Note that if a new body part has been added to the `config.yaml` file after having started to label, loading the config in the GUI is necessary to update the dropdown menus and other metadata.***

    ***As `viridis` is `napari-deeplabcut` default colormap, loading the config in the GUI is also needed to update the color scheme.***

3. **Refining labels** – the image folder contains a `machinelabels-iter<#>.h5` file.

    The process is analog to *2*.
    Open *napari* and open an image folder.
    If the video was originally labeled, *and* had outliers extracted it will contain a `CollectedData_<ScorerName>.h5` file and a `machinelabels-iter<#>.h5` file. In this case, select the `machinelabels` layer in the GUI, and type `e` to show edges. Red indicates likelihood < 0.6. As you navigate through frames, images with labels with edges will need to be refined (moved, deleted, etc). Images with labels without edges will be on the `CollectedData` (previous manual annotations) layer and shouldn't need refining. However, you can switch to that layer and fix errors. You can also right-click on the `CollectedData` layer and select `toggle visibility` to hide that layer. Select the `machinelabels` layer before saving which will append your refined annotations to `CollectedData`.

    If the folder only had outliers extracted and wasn't originally labeled, it will not have a `CollectedData` layer. Work with the `machinelabels` layer selected to refine annotation positions, then save.

    In this case, it is not necessary to open the DLC project's `config.yaml` file, as all necessary metadata is read from the `h5` data file.

    Saving works as described in *1*.

4. **Drawing segmentation masks**

    Drop an image folder as in *1*, manually add a *shapes layer*. Then select the *rectangle* in the layer controls (top left pane),
    and start drawing rectangles over the images. Masks and rectangle vertices are saved as described in [Save Layers](#save-layers).
    Note that masks can be reloaded and edited at a later stage by dropping the `vertices.csv` file onto the canvas.

```

### Labeling multiple image folders

Labeling multiple image folders has to be done in sequence; i.e., only one image folder can be opened at a time.
After labeling the images of a particular folder is done and the associated *Points layer* has been saved, *all* layers should be removed from the layers list (lower left pane on the GUI) by selecting them and clicking on the trashcan icon.
Now, another image folder can be labeled, following the process described in *1*, *2*, or *3*, depending on the particular image folder.


### Defining cropping coordinates

Prior to defining cropping coordinates, two elements should be loaded in the GUI:
a video and the DLC project's `config.yaml` file (into which the crop dimensions will be stored).
Then it suffices to add a `Shapes layer`, draw a `rectangle` in it with the desired area,
and hit the button `Store crop coordinates`; coordinates are automatically written to the configuration file.

A [napari] plugin for zero-shot image segmentation using DINOv2 vision transformers.

----------------------------------

## Overview

`napari-DINOSim` enables zero-shot image segmentation by selecting reference points on an image. The plugin leverages DINOv2's powerful feature extraction capabilities to compute similarity maps and generate segmentation masks.

For detailed information about the widget's functionality, UI elements, and usage instructions, please refer to the [Plugin Documentation](./docs/plugin_documentation.md). A simple [example notebook](./src/DINOSim_example.ipynb) demonstrating how to use DINOSim programmatically is also available.

## Installation

You can install `napari-DINOSim` via [pip]:

```sh
pip install napari-dinosim
```

or from source using [conda]:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AAitorG/napari-DINOSim.git
cd napari-DINOSim

# Create and activate the conda environment
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate napari-dinosim
```

## Usage

To launch napari, run the following command in your terminal:

```sh
napari
```

Within the napari interface, locate and click the `DINOSim segmentation` plugin in the Plugins section of the top bar. You can then:
1. Drag and drop your image into the napari viewer
2. Select points on the objects you want to segment
3. The plugin will automatically generate segmentation masks based on your selections

This tool is a demo tool for DeepMeta network.

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

## Installation

You can install `napari-deepmeta` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-deepmeta



To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/EdgarLefevre/napari-deepmeta.git


## Usage

This plugin is designed to process your mouse MRI images with our dataset. It comes with a demo, including one of our
test images.

By opening the deepmeta demo plugin, you will see an interface with one unique button, by clicking on it, it will load an image,
run prediction and then draw the masks contours on each slice.

If you open the deepmeta plugin, you will see an interface with one button and 3 checkboxes.
By checking the checkboxes, you add steps to the pipeline (enhance contrast, do postprocessing, segment metastases).
Once everything is setup, just click on the button and wait (the waiting time depends on your computer performance.)

## Quick start
A detailed guide and tutorial can be found on the [Wiki pages of this repo](https://github.com/hejDMC/napari-dmc-brainmap/wiki).

### Installation

DMC-BrainMap is a plugin for [napari](https://napari.org/stable/). Hence, you first need to install napari and subsequently the DMC-BrainMap plugin via the plugin manager. To install napari, we recommend to install napari into a clean virtual environment using *conda* or *venv*. Please refer to the [napari installation guide](https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/fundamentals/installation.html#napari-installation) for more information and [for information on installing napari as a bundled app](https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/fundamentals/installation.html#napari-installation).  

#### Step 1: Setup the virtual environment (Python 3.10)

```
conda create -y -n napari-env -c conda-forge python=3.10
conda activate napari-env
```

#### Step 2: Install napari

```
python -m pip install ""napari[all]""
```

#### Step 3: Install napari-dmc-brainmap

You can install `napari-dmc-brainmap` via the napari plugin manager or via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/napari-dmc-brainmap/):

    pip install napari-dmc-brainmap

### Usage

Please refer to the Wiki pages for detailed instructions and a short tutorial on how to use DMC-BrainMap. When working with DMC-BrainMap on your own data, please keep the following points in mind:
- DMC-BrainMap requires single-channel 16-bit .tif/.tiff images to work (in principle 8-bit also work)
- DMC-BrainMap requires that your data is organized by animals in separate folders (you can pool data later down the lane)
- DMC-BrainMap uses 5 channel labels (`dapi`, `green`, `n3`, `cy3`, `cy5`) corresponding to blue, green, orange, red and far red channels. *However, these are only labels, you can assign them as you please. Hence, you can use DMC-BrainMap also for non-fluorescence data given you converted your images to single-channel 16-bit .tif/.tiff images*. Please contact us if you need to use more than 5 channels.
- It is essential that you structure your data in the following way (hierarchical organization, same name for images in different channels, channel labels are selected by you), **otherwise DMC-BrainMap won't work**:
```
animal_id-001
│
└───stitched
│   │
│   └───dapi
│   |    │   animal_id-001_001.tiff
│   |    │   animal_id-001_002.tiff
|   │    |   animal_id-001_003.tiff
│   |    │   animal_id-001_004.tiff
│   |    │   ...
│   │   
│   └───green
│       │   animal_id-001_001.tiff
│       │   animal_id-001_002.tiff
│       │   animal_id-001_003.tiff
│       │   animal_id-001_004.tiff
│       │   ...
│   
animal_id-2
│   ...
```

See [full documentation](https://true-north-intelligent-algorithms.github.io/napari-easy-augment-batch-dl/)

A plugin to perform deep learning on small to medium sized image sets with UNETs, Cellpose, Stardist, SAM and friends.  In particular this plugin is useful for performing deep learning with a small number of labels and augmentation, and experimenting with different deep learning frameworks.  

Important note on dependencies:  This plugin is designed to work with different permutations of dependencies.  For example it should work if one of Pytorch, Cellpose, SAM and/or Stardist is installed but does not require all.   Thus we don't specify all the dependencies and leave it up to the user to install the permutation of DL related dependencies they would like to use.  More detailed instructions are below. 

If you have any questions about dependencies splease post on the [Image.sc](Image.sc) forum. 

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/stable/plugins/index.html
-->

## Installation

To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/bnorthan/napari-easy-augment-batch-dl.git

You will also need to install the latest development version of tnia-python:

    pip install git+https://github.com/True-North-Intelligent-Algorithms/tnia-python.git

You will need to install napari and for augmentation you will need albumentations library.  Also explicitly install numpy 1.26.  (We have not tested with numpy 2.0 so it is a good idea to explicitly install numpy 1.26 to avoid another dependency installing numpy 2.x)

```
    pip install numpy==1.26
    pip install napari[all]
    pip install albumentations
    pip install matplotlib
```

You will also need one or more of stardist, cellpose, segment-everything or Yolo

### Stardist

#### Windows

```
    conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.2 cudnn=8.1.0
    pip install ""tensorflow<2.11""
    pip install stardist==0.8.5
    pip install gputools
    pip install edt
```

#### Linux

```
    pip install tensorflow[and-cuda]
    pip install stardist
    pip install gputools
    pip install edt
```

### Pytorch (for unet segmentation)

```
    pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
    pip install pytorch-lightning
    pip install monai
    pip install scipy
    pip install tifffile
```

### Cellpose

```
    pip install cellpose
```

### SAM (Segment Anything)

```
    pip install segment-everything
```

###

An experimental plugin for viewing Deep Zoom Images (DZI) with napari + zarr + dask.

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using with [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

## Description 

The [DZI File Format](https://github.com/openseadragon/openseadragon/wiki/The-DZI-File-Format) 
is a pyramidal tile source specification where individual tiles are RGB/RGBA JPEG/PNG images. 
DZI is a very popular tile source for zoomable web-viewers like 
[OpenSeadragon](https://openseadragon.github.io/), and as a result many tile sources are available over 
HTTP. This plugin wraps a DZI tile source (local or remote) as a multiscale Zarr, where each pyramidal level is a `zarr.Array` of shape `(level_height, level_width, 3/4)`, allowing the same images to be viewed 
in `napari` + `dask`.

## Installation

You can install `napari-dzi-zarr` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-dzi-zarr


## Usage

This high-resolution scan of Rembrandt's Night Watch is available thanks to [R.G Erdmann](https://twitter.com/erdmann). More examples can be found on [boschproject.org](http://boschproject.org).

![NapariEMD screenshots](Images/napariEMD_screenshots.jpg)

## To Do

- Attatch last-opened information, so the widget does not reset when frames are changed and open toggle options are open remain.
- Add a search bar for navigating metadata.
- Output metadata as file option.
- Add note to change order of open files to replacee active metadata view.
- Make Singleframe note update automatically on change of file order.

Plugin to run [EpySeg](https://github.com/baigouy/EPySeg) directly in [Napari](https://napari.org/stable/).
Can handle temporal data (movie) or single time point (image).

## Installation

To install it from Napari, go into the `Plugins` menu, select `Install/Uninstall Plugins..` and look for napari-epyseg in the plugins list.

To install it directly outside of napari, create/reuse and activate a python environement, e.g `epyseg_env` and install it with `pip`:
```
pip install napari-epyseg
```

## Usage

In Napari, go to `Plugins>napari-epyseg` to start it.
It will open an interface in the left part of the main window.

![interface_image](./imgs/napepy-interface.png)

You must select the layer (image or movie, single color channel) on which to run `EpySeg`.
For this, in the `Pick an Image` parameter, select the corresponding layer (you should open the image/movie independantly of the plugin).

To run `EpySeg` with default parameters, press directly `Segment` once you have selected the image.
When processing is finished, a new layer called `Segmentation` will be added in the right panel of the interface.
You can save the result with the `Save segmentation` button that appears on the left part of the interface. 
Choose where to save the file and the file name with the `Segmentation filename` parameter, and click the button to save it.

https://napari.org/stable/plugins/index.html
-->

## Installation

You can install `napari-fast4dreg` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-fast4dreg

## Usage 

It's easy! 
1) Just drag and drop your image, or the test image from this repository, into napari and open it normally. 
Don't worry if your file is big, napari already internally uses dask to open even the biggest images (although it might hurt the performance).
2) Open the napari-fast4dreg plugin from the plugin menu.
3) In the image row, make sure your image is selected in the image drop down menu.
4) In the axes row, choose the structure of your input image. If your axis orientation is correct in ImageJ choose the standard TZCYX (ImageJ) orientation. If you are using python to process the image you probabbly are using the alternatively availabe CTZYX orientation. In this case just select CTZYX in the drop down menu instead.
5) Select the reference channel used for the registration. The drift will be determined for this reference channel and applied to all other channels. Counting begins by 0. In case for the test image we select the nuclear signal in channel 1.
6) Select the corrections that you want to apply on your image. Note that the crop function reduces only in xy, according to the previously determined drift. (e.g. drift = -5 in x --> drop 5 pixels from the left hand side of the registered stack.)
7) Wait for output (this may take a while, so go and get a coffe or tea).
8) Enjoy your registered image.


## Example Outcome
The output will consist of the following (if chosen): 
- registered.tif: The registered file, output of this image registration pipeline.
- tmp_data: This folder was used for temporary data saving and stores at the end the registered image in a chunked manner (can be deleted or dragged into napari for a greater data versatility)
- drifts.csv: csv table, home to the drift of all corrected variables, if you prefer your own plotting style, here is where you find the pure drift table.
- XY-Drift.svg: Vector based graphic, visualising the drift in lateral direction. The svg format can be opened by your web browser or directly imported to powerpoint. Key advantage of .svg instead of .png: You can resize any way you like without loss of image quality.
- Z-Drift.svg: Vector based graphic, visualising the drift in axial direction.
- Rotation-Drift.svg: Showing rotation correction of the image in lateral direction.

Want to help out napari?  Install this plugin!

This plugin will automatically send error reports to napari (via
[sentry.io](https://sentry.io)) whenever an exception occurs while you are using
napari.

The first time you run napari after installing this plugin an opt-in
notification will appear (Be sure to click ""yes"", otherwise no reports will be
collected or sent).  You may opt back out at any time in napari's help menu.

Every effort is made to strip these reports of personally identifiable
information.  Here is an example exception event:

Thank you!!

## Privacy FAQ

Even with the multiple layers of opt-ins, and the attempts to wipe all personal info
prior to sending reports, we understand that privacy is always a concern.

### Do you collect personal info?

We make every attempt to collect ***no*** personally identifiable information.  No
name, location, IP address, etc...  We do collect your
([`uuid.getnode()`](https://docs.python.org/3.10/library/uuid.html#uuid.getnode)) to
be able to track bug resolution over time. As mentioned above, allowing local
variables to be collected may occasionally include a file path in the log.
If that concerns you, please leave that unchecked.

### Is this shipped with napari?

`napari-error-reporter` is **not** bundled with napari or listed as a napari dependency.
In order for reports to be sent, you must first install this plugin yourself, and then
opt in on the next launch.  If you uninstall the plugin, no more reports can be sent.

### Who can access these reports?

Only the following napari core developers have access to these reports.
If [this](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tlambert03/napari-error-reporter/main/ADMINS)
list changes in the future, you will be asked to opt-in again in napari:

- Juan Nunez-Iglesias ([@jni](https://github.com/jni))
- Talley Lambert ([@tlambert03](https://github.com/tlambert03))

*This plugin is **not** associated with the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative*.

### How will these reports be used?

Commonly occuring errors will be will be manually purged of file paths and
local variables and posted to https://github.com/napari/napari/issues

### How long is data retained

Sentry retains event data for 90 days by default.  For complete details,
see Sentry's page on [Security & Compliance](https://sentry.io/security/)

An interactive classifier plugin that allows the user to assign objects in a label image to multiple classes and train a classifier to learn those classes based on a feature dataframe.

## Usage
<p align=""center""><img src=""https://github.com/fractal-napari-plugins-collection/napari-feature-classifier/assets/18033446/1ebf0890-1a7b-4e4b-a21c-88ca8f1dd800"" /></p>

To use the napari-feature-classifier, you need to have a label image and corresponding measurements: as a csv file, loaded to layer.features or in an [OME-Zarr Anndata table loaded with another plugin](https://github.com/fractal-napari-plugins-collection/napari-ome-zarr-navigator). Your feature measurements need to contain a `label` column that matches the label objects in the label image.
These interactive classification workflows are well suited to visually define cell types, find mitotic cells in images, do quality control by automatically detecting missegmented cells and other tasks where a user can easily assign objects to groups.

#### Prepare the label layer:
- Load your label layer into napari and add the features measurements to layer.features of the corresponding label layer. You can have multiple label layers with their features open at the same time
    - To load features from a CSV file: `Plugins -> napari-feature-classifier -> CSV Feature Loader`, then load the features for the correct label image.
    - To load features from an OME-Zarr file: Get both the label layer into memory as a normal label layer (not a pyramidal label layer, currently untested) and the corresponding features. If your OME-Zarr file is created by [Fractal](https://fractal-analytics-platform.github.io/), you can use [this ROI loader plugin](https://github.com/jluethi/napari-ome-zarr-roi-loader).
    - To load features from anywhere else, load them manually to your label_layer.features
- Your feature table should have 2 columns used for indexing (but stored as normal columns in layer.features):
    - The `label` column to match the object in the label image
    - The `roi_id` column to identify the image you're currently classifying (used when a classifier is trained on multiple label images)


#### Initialize a classifier:
- Start the classifier in napari by going to `Plugins -> napari-feature-classifier -> Initialize a Classifier`  
- Select the features you want to use for the classifier (you need to do the feature selection before initializing. The feature selection can't be changed after initialization anymore). Hold the command key to select multiple features. Feature options are always shown for the features available in the last selected label layer, based on layer.features available features.
- (Optional) Give your classes recognizable names (e.g. Mitotic & Interphase, Cell Type a, b and c etc.)

#### Classify objects:
<img width=""1802"" alt=""Classifier_annotation"" src=""https://github.com/fractal-napari-plugins-collection/napari-feature-classifier/assets/18033446/556739b8-972b-4570-9da4-637738fc6a75"">

- Make sure you have the label layer selected on which you want to classify
- Select the current class with the radio buttons or by pressing 0, 1, 2, etc.
- Click on label objects in the viewer to assign them to the currently selected class
- Once you have trained enough examples, click ""Run Classifier"" to run the classifier and have it make a prediction for all objects. Aim for at least a dozen annotations per class, as the classifier divides your annotations 80/20 in training and test sets. 
- Once you get predictions, correct mistakes the classifier made and retrain it to improve its performance.
- You can save the classifier under a different name or in a different location. Define the new output location and then click `Save Classifier` (you need to click the Save Classifier button. Just defining the new output path does not save it yet. But every run of the classifier triggers an autosave)
<img width=""1802"" alt=""Classifier_prediction"" src=""https://github.com/fractal-napari-plugins-collection/napari-feature-classifier/assets/18033446/69cff600-4585-4a66-9274-d2e7caeb335f"">



#### Apply the classifier to additional images:
- You can apply a classifier trained on one image to additional label images. Use `Plugins -> napari-feature-classifier -> Load Classifier`  
- Select the classifier (.clf file with the name you gave above) while already having the label images ready (see `Prepare the label layer` above).
- Click Load Classifier, proceed as above.
<img width=""1606"" alt=""Screenshot 2023-05-09 at 12 01 00"" src=""https://github.com/fractal-napari-plugins-collection/napari-feature-classifier/assets/18033446/e1143f9f-9729-4f8e-979c-2ab195e0aaca"">



#### Export classifier results
- To export the training data and the results of the classifier, define an Export Name (full path to an output file or just a filename ending in .csv) where the results of the classifier shall be saved. It defaults to the layer name for the selected layer in the last directory you chose (or the current working directory if none was chosen so far)
- Click `Export Classifier Result` (Just selecting a filename is not enough, you need to click the export button). This will export the predictions for the currently selected layer.
- The results of the classifier are save in a csv file. The label is an integer of the label object within that image. The prediction column contains predictions of the classifier for all objects (except those that contained NaNs in their feature data) and the annotation column contains the annotations you made (NaN for unclassified objects, -1 for objects you deselected, 1 - 9 for the classes)
<img width=""1802"" alt=""Classifier_prediction"" src=""https://github.com/fractal-napari-plugins-collection/napari-feature-classifier/assets/18033446/e8f6f7b7-d88b-44f8-b43e-8a2fa81e18d4"">


#### Batch mode result export
(To be updated: Create a new notebook to run batch processing, this is for the older version of the classifier)
There is a simple workflow for the classifier in the examples folder:
- Install jupyter-lab (`pip install jupyterlab`)
- Open the notebook in jupyter lab (Type `jupyter-lab` in the terminal when you are in the examples folder)
- Follow the instructions to generate an example dataframe and an example label image
- Use the classifier in napari with this simplified data


#### Initializing the Annotator
You can use the annotation functionality also independently from the classifier
Start the annotator widget by going to `Plugins -> napari-feature-classifier -> Annotator`
Select names for your classes. You can name up to 9 classes. Only classes that you give a name will be created upon initialization.
Then click `Initialize`.

A annotator widget opens. Use the Radio-Buttons to select what class you're annotating (or keybindings for 1-9 for classes, 0 for deselect).
The annotator will always work on the currently selected label layer. While the annotator is open, you can't edit the labels. Restart napari to allow editing of labels again.

The annotations are saved in the `layer.features` table of the corresponding label layer as an `annotations` column.

## Installation

This plugin is written for the new napari npe2 plugin engine. Thus, it requires napari >= 0.4.13.
Activate your environment where you have napari installed (or install napari using `pip install ""napari[all]""`), then install the classifier plugin:

    pip install napari-feature-classifier

The layer.features dataframes have some issues in napari 0.4.17 (see [here](https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/5617)). They seem to be working again in the nighlty builds. To set up a nightly builds napari env, do the following:

```
conda create -n classifier-dev-napari-main -c ""napari/label/nightly"" -c conda-forge napari python=3.10 -y
```

1. Update the version number in src/napari-feature-classifier/__init__.py
2. Update the version in setup.cfg
3. Add a Github release with a new version tag (matching the version set above)
4. Once tests pass, this should automatically be deployed to pypi
5. Wait for conda automation to make a PR for an updated conda release (see https://github.com/conda-forge/napari-feature-classifier-feedstock). This can take 1-2 days. Make sure that PR gets merged.

<img src=""https://github.com/GuignardLab/tapenade/blob/main/imgs/tapenade3.png"" width=""100"">

A plugin to inspect bioimages (e.g. .tif, .czi, .nd2, .lsm...) and save them as individual .tif files in a folder.

`napari-file2folder` is a [napari] plugin that is part of the [Tapenade](https://github.com/GuignardLab/tapenade) project. Tapenade is a tool for the analysis of dense 3D tissues acquired with deep imaging microscopy. It is designed to be user-friendly and to provide a comprehensive analysis of the data.

If you use this plugin for your research, please [cite us](https://github.com/GuignardLab/tapenade/blob/main/README.md#how-to-cite).

## Overview

<img src=""imgs/napari-file2folder-demo.gif""/>

This plugin allows you to inspect (possibly large) bioimages by displaying their shape (number of elements in each dimension), and allowing you to save each element along a chosen dimension as a separate .tif file in a folder. This is useful when you have a large movie or stack of images and you want to save each frame or slice as a separate file. Optionally, the plugin allows the user to visualize the middle element of a given dimension to help the user decide which dimension to save as separate files.

The plugin currently supports the following file formats:
- .tif
- .ome.tiff
- .zarr
- .ome.zarr
- .nd2
- .lsm
- .czi

This plugin leverages [tifffile], [bioio], and [zarr] to circumvent loading the entire images in memory, which allows inspection of very large images.

> [!CAUTION]
> When inspecting the middle element of a dimension, or when saving one element of a dimension as a separate file, the plugin loads the element in memory, which means that at least this lone element must fit in memory.

## Installation

The plugin obviously requires [napari] to run. If you don't have it yet, follow the instructions [here](https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/fundamentals/installation.html).

The simplest way to install `napari-file2folder` is via the [napari] plugin manager. Open Napari, go to `Plugins > Install/Uninstall Packages...` and search for `napari-file2folder`. Click on the install button and you are ready to go!

You can install `napari-file2folder` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-file2folder

A napari plugin for filament analysis.

This plugin helps you to manually track filaments using path shapes of `Shapes` layer.

![](https://github.com/hanjinliu/napari-filaments/raw/main/resources/fit.gif)

Currently implemented functions

- Fit paths to filaments in an image as a 2-D spline curve.
- Clip/extend paths.
- Measurement of filament length at sub-pixel precision.
- Basic quantification (mean, std, etc.) along paths.
- Import paths from ImageJ ROI file.

Basic Usage
-----------

Click `Layers > open image` to open a tif file. You'll find the image you chose and a shapes layer are added to the layer list.

![](https://github.com/hanjinliu/napari-filaments/raw/main/resources/fig-1.png)

- The ""target filaments"" box shows the working shapes layer.
- The ""target image"" box shows the image layer on which fitting and quantification will be conducted.
- The ""filament"" box shows currently selected shape (initially this box is empty).

Add path shapes and push key `F1` to fit the shape to the filament in the target image layer.

- In the ""Spline"" tab, you can cut/extend or re-fit splines.
- In the ""Measure"" tab, click ""measure property"" to measure mean instensity etc along each spline.

How it works
------------

Spline fitting is done as following.

A simple plugin to filter labels by properties.

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [copier] using the [napari-plugin-template].

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/napari-plugin-template#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/stable/plugins/index.html
-->
## Description

This plugin provides the possibility to filter segmentation objects by measurements
(shape and intensity). E.g. you segmented your cells, and you want to exclude segmentation objects
that have a mean intensity below a certain value.

It is intended for 2D and 3D images.

You can interactively set minimum and maximum thresholds on measurement properties, and
napari will show a preview of the selection.

Measurements are based on `scikit-image regionprops`. However, not all properties are
implemented, and they are more restricted for 3D images.

## Usage: Quick start

![](https://github.com/loicsauteur/napari-filter-labels-by-prop/raw/main/resources/preview_filter_labels.gif)

1. Start napari
2. Start the plugin from the menu: `Plugins > Filter labels by properties`
3. Add a label image
4. (optionally) Add a corresponding intensity image with the same (Z)YX shape
5. In the widget, select the property you want to filter on
6. Adjust the min/max sliders
7. When you are ready to create a new label layer click the `Create labels` button in the widget

### Usage notes:

When dealing with more than 100 label objects in an image, the filtering view update is
triggered only once you release the sliders.

Another similar plugin you could consider checking out:
[napari-skimage-regionprops](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-skimage-regionprops).

Pixel/Voxel size are read from the napari layer scale attribute (defaults to 1 if not specified when adding the layer).
You can manually enter the size and press the `Set` button, which will set the layer scale,
and measure the shape properties with calibrated units

The ""Measure projected shape properties"" option is only available for 3D images.
It measures additional properties of Z-projected labels (including: ""area"", ""convex_area"", ""circularity"" and ""perimeter"").

The ""Measure cytoplasm and cell compartments"" is intended for label images that represent nuclei.
With this option selected, cytoplasm and cell masks will be created by a dilation of 5 units (pixels or calibrated).
Measurement in those compartments will be made and be used to filter on.
`Create labels` will also add the respective cytoplasm and cell mask layers to the napari viewer.

<!--
         ## TODO: add feature measurement also to layer.features?
-->
## Installation

You can install `napari-filter-labels-by-prop` via [pip]:

Napari-flim-phasor-plotter is a [napari](https://napari.org/stable/) plugin to interactively load and show raw fluorescence lifetime imaging microscopy (FLIM) single images and series and generate phasor plots. These are Fourier transforms of the decay data being visualized using the [napari-clusters-plotter](https://github.com/BiAPoL/napari-clusters-plotter) plotter, adapted to suit the FLIM context. This allows qualitative and quantitative downstream analysis of FLIM images.

Findaureus is a tool designed to identify bacteria in infected bone tissue images obtained via Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy (CLSM). This tool can be accessed independently [here](https://github.com/shibarjun/Findaureus). Findaureus has been integrated as a plugin for napari. In addition to its bacteria-locating algorithm, the napari viewer provides improved visualization features, in 2D and 3D perspectives.

This is a `napari` plugin developed for using FluoResFM model in napari.
FluoresFM is a deep learning-based foundation model for multi-task cross-distribution restoration of fluorescence microscopic images.

FluoResFM's `napari` plugin is in early satge, therefore I highly encourage any feedback and suggestions.

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [copier] using the [napari-plugin-template].

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/napari-plugin-template#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/stable/plugins/index.html
-->

## Before Installation
As FluoResFM is a deep learning-based model, it is recommended to use a GPU for inference and training on Linux system. So no choice to use CPU is provided in the plugin. Besides, as the code is depended on PyTorch and `triton` packages, you should install the plugin through command lines.

I recommand you to install the plugin in a new envoroment created by `conda` .

 First, create a new environment with `conda` and activate it.
```
conda create -y --name napari-fluoresfm python=3.12
conda activate napari-fluoresfm
```

Then, install `napari`.
```
pip install -U ""napari[all]""
```

To use GPU for inference and training, you should install the GPU version of PyTorch. You can use `nvcc -V` to check the cuda version. Then install the corresponding version of PyTorch by check the [table](https://pytorch.org/get-started/previous-versions/) provided by PyTorch. For example, if you have `cuda 12.4`, you should install the following version of PyTorch.
```
pip install torch==2.6.0 torchvision==0.21.0 torchaudio==2.6.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
```

We recommend you using Linux for training and inference, as the `triton` support for Windows is not stable. And the with Linux system, the acceleration of `triton` is much better than Windows, which allow larger `batch size` and `patch size` to be used in training and inference.

If you are using Windows, you should install the `triton` package first according the PyTorch version you installed. Please check this [link](https://github.com/woct0rdho/triton-windows?tab=readme-ov-file#3-pytorch) for more details.
```
pip install -U ""triton-windows<3.3""
```

## Installation

You can install `napari-fluoresfm` via [pip]:

```
pip install napari-fluoresfm
```

To install latest development version :

```
pip install git+https://github.com/qiqi-lu/napari-fluoresfm.git
```

## Functions
This plugin can be used for data preprocessing, model training, and model inference.

![interface](src/napari_fluoresfm/images/interface.png)
**Figure 1: The interface of the plugin.** **a** The label page uased for prediction of restored images. **b** The page for data preprocessing, including data patching and text embedding modules. **c** The page for model training.

**Each page can be run independetly. You only need to input the data and model information as described below from top to bottom, and click `run` button to start. To train or fine-tune the mdoel, you need to preprocess the data firstly using the `Preprocess` page. The training and fine-tuning can both be done in `Train` page.**

### Predict
This label page is used for prediction of restored images. You can select the pretrained model and the input image to predict the restored image.
#### PATH box
This box is used to select the folder for data and models.
- **Input Folder**: The folder containing the input images. The input images should be in `.tif` format with a shape of `(1, H, W)` or `(H, W)`. The model will restored the images one by one and save them into the **Output Folder**.
- **Index File**: This should be a `.txt` file containing all the file names of the images to be restored in each line. The file name should be the same as the file name of the input images.
- **Output Folder** (optional): The folder to save the restored images. If not specified, the restored images will be saved into the `#Input Folder#_fluoresfm`.
- **Embedder**: The folder saved the text embedder model. You can download the text model from my [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pfiCHtXrf5ne6fjKJQAvwQhgBO_yVpWy?usp=sharing).
- **Checkpoint**: The pre-trained FluoResFM model checkpoint with a suffix `.pt`.

#### PARAMETERS box
This box is used to set the parameters for prediction.
- **Device**: The device to run the model. Only support `cuda`.
- **Compile model**: Whether to compile the model. If checked, the model will be compiled with `triton` for faster inference and lower BPU memory usage. But the compile process will take a few minutes. if only a few image to be restored, you can uncheck this box.
- **Input interpolation (nearest)**: Do nearest interpolation on the input image to implement super-resolution task, as the input and output image of FluoResFM have the save shape.
- **Batch size**: The batch size used during inference. Larger batch size will use more memory and faster inference. If your GPU memory is not enough, you can reduce this value.
- **Patch size**: The patch size used during inference. Larger patch size will use more memory. If your GPU memory is not enough, you can reduce this value. Different pacth size may lead to slightly different results due to the patch stiching process.
#### TEXT box
This box is used to set the text prompt for the model.
- **Task**: The task to be performed. For example, ""denoising"", ""deconvolution"", or ""super-resolution with a scale factor of 2"". When inputing ""super-resolution with a scale factor of 2"", the **Input interpolation (nearest)** should be also set as 2. Other tasks may result in unexpected results as the model is not trained for these tasks.
- **Sample**: The image sample. For example, ""fixed COS-7 cell line"".
- **Structure**: The imaging structure. For example, ""microtubules"".
- **Fluorescence indicator**: The fluorescence indicator. For example, ""mEmerald (GFP)"".
- **INPUT**: The imaging condition of image image.
    - **Microscope**: The microscope used for imaging. Such as, ""wide-field microscope"".
    - **Mircoscopy params**: The microscope parameters. For example, ""with excitation numrical aperture (NA) of 1.35, detection namerical aperture (NA) of 1.3"".
    - **Pixel size**: The pixel size of the image. For example, ""62.6 x 62.6 nm"".

- **OUTPUT**: The imaging condition of the target image.
    - **Microscope**: The microscope used for imaging. Such as, ""linear structured illumination microscopy"".
    - **Mircoscopy params**: The microscope parameters. For example, ""with excitation numrical aperture (NA) of 1.35, detection namerical aperture (NA) of 1.3"".
    - **Pixel size**: The pixel size of the image. For example, ""62.6 x 62.6 nm"".

## Installation

You can install `napari-geff` via [pip]:

```
pip install napari-geff
```

If napari is not already installed, you can install `napari-geff` with napari and Qt via:

```
pip install ""napari-geff[all]""
```

## Usage

`napari-geff` supports loading directed graphs stored as [GEFF](https://live-image-tracking-tools.github.io/geff/latest/) files into
`napari` as `Tracks` layers, and saving them back out to GEFF format.

To use `napari-geff` after installation, simply drag a GEFF file into the viewer and select `GEFF IO` from the
plugin selection dialog, if required. The file will be loaded as a `Tracks` layer.

Any node properties defined on your graph will be stored as features on your tracks layer. Edge properties
will be available under `layer.metadata['edge_properties']` as a dictionary, but cannot currently be displayed
or used for visualization in `napari`.

If your file contains `image` or `labels` related objects as per the GEFF
[spec](https://live-image-tracking-tools.github.io/geff/v0.4.0/specification/#geff_related_objects),
these will also be loaded alongside your `Tracks` layer.

If you wish to open your geff file into layers **programmatically**, you can do so using the `viewer.open` method:

```python
import napari
path = 'path/to/top_level_zarr.zarr/my-geff-group/

viewer = napari.Viewer()
layers = viewer.open(path, plugin='napari-geff')
```

This plugin provides for analysis tools for data from single particle tracking experiments.  It provides an interface for particle localization and tracking using [trackpy](http://soft-matter.github.io/trackpy/dev/index.html).  It also allows for import of tracking data from Mosaic and Trackmate.  These files must be tab/comma delimited text files.  It provides an option to exclude particles/tracks masked with a labels layer.

There are 5 tabs available in the plugin, following the workflow of data analysis:

1) **New/Open**: open nd2/tiff time-lapse movie files and/or import a tracks layer (from Mosaic, Trackmate or napari-gemspa saved tracks layer)
2) **Locate**: locate particles with trackpy
3) **Link**: link particles with trackpy
4) **Filter Links**: filter links with trackpy
5) **Analyze**: Perform analysis on tracks from a tracks layer (can be from imported file from step 1 or layer created in step 3)

**Detailed description of features:**

1) **New/Open**

![My Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liamholtlab/napari-gemspa/main/screen_shots/1_1.png)

**Add layer** button will create a blank 2D (no time dimension) layer that is the same height/width as the currently selected image layer.  Alternatively, a labeled mask can be opened from a file.  The labels layer can be used to provide a mask for excluding areas of the image from analysis.

Track files from other software or previously saved by GEMspa can also be imported in this pane.  Only tab/comma (.csv/.txt/.tsv) delimited text files are allowed.

**GEMspa** expects these columns in the header: ['track_id', 'frame', 'z', 'y', 'x']

**Mosaic** expects these columns in the header: ['Trajectory', 'Frame', 'z', 'y', 'x']

**Trackmate** expects these columns in the header: ['TRACK_ID', 'FRAME', 'POSITION_Z', 'POSITION_Y', 'POSITION_X'],
* 3 rows will be skipped for Trackmate files (assumes data begins at the 4th row after the header)

**Trackpy** expects these columns in the header: ['particle', 'frame', 'z', 'y', 'x']

_(All columns are case and order insensitive)_

2) **Locate**
![My Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liamholtlab/napari-gemspa/main/screen_shots/2_1.png)

In this tab, adjust the parameters and perform particle localization with [trackpy.locate](http://soft-matter.github.io/trackpy/dev/generated/trackpy.locate.html#trackpy.locate).  To first test out parameters on a single frame, check the ""Process only current frame"" checkbox.  Please refer to the trackpy documentation for more details on parameters.

After localization is performed, a new points layer will be created and particles will be shown circled in red.  In the example, we have used a labels layer to exclude particles outside an ROI (this is optional):

![My Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liamholtlab/napari-gemspa/main/screen_shots/2_2.png)

In addition, the mass histogram and subpixel bias histograms will be shown for help with adjusting the mass and diameter parameters:

![My Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liamholtlab/napari-gemspa/main/screen_shots/2_3.png)

3) **Link**

![My Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liamholtlab/napari-gemspa/main/screen_shots/3_1.png)

In this tab, adjust parameters and perform linking with [trackpy.link](http://soft-matter.github.io/trackpy/dev/generated/trackpy.link.html).  Once linking is performed a new tracks layer will be added.  Please refer to the trackpy documentation for more details on parameters.

In addition, scatter plots of mass vs. size and mass vs. eccentricity, as well as the track lengths histogram are shown for help with filtering tracks. (next step)

![My Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liamholtlab/napari-gemspa/main/screen_shots/3_2.png)

4) **Filter**

![My Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liamholtlab/napari-gemspa/main/screen_shots/4_1.png)

In this tab, adjust parameters and filter links from trackpy output.  After filtering, a new layer will be added to napari with the filtered tracks and the same plots as shown in step 4 will be displayed.

5) **Analyze**

![My Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liamholtlab/napari-gemspa/main/screen_shots/5_1.png)

In this tab, adjust parameters and perform analysis.  You may process all tracks or enter a track id and deselect the ""Process all tracks"" check box.  Enter the appropriate parameters for converting pixels to microns and the time lag (in seconds) between frames of the movie.  

GEMspa will calculate the effective diffusion coefficient (D) for each track based on the mean squared displacement values (MSD) for each time-lag using this equation:

![My Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liamholtlab/napari-gemspa/main/screen_shots/5_2.png)

This is the diffusion coefficient with the assumption of Brownian motion.  GEMspa will also calculate the generalized diffusion coefficient and anomalous exponent using this equation:

![My Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liamholtlab/napari-gemspa/main/screen_shots/5_3.png)

The fitting is performed on a log-log scale where the slope corresponds to the anomalous exponent (alpha):

![My Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liamholtlab/napari-gemspa/main/screen_shots/5_4.png)

**Definition of terms:**

![My Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liamholtlab/napari-gemspa/main/screen_shots/5_5.png)

This review: [Manzo et al](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26511974/)  is useful for learning more about these and other analysis methods.

**Min track len for fit**: all tracks less than this length will be excluded from calculations of effective diffusion coefficient and anomalous exponent.

**Max time lag for fit**: GEMspa will fit the MSD up to the max time-lag entered here.  (in frames)

**Fit with error term**: check this box to allow a y-intercept when fitting for effective diffusion coefficient:

![My Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liamholtlab/napari-gemspa/main/screen_shots/5_6.png)

Check these papers by [Martin, et al](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006349502739714) and [Xavier Michalet](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3055791/) for some information on fitting MSD with localization error.

**Rainbow tracks**

GEMspa can output a plot where the tracks are colored by any of the listed quantities.  Check each box that you would like to see.  

For the effective diffusion coefficient and anomalous exponent, set the Min/Max cutoffs for the track color map.  Any tracks at or below the minimum will be colored with the minimum color (blue).  Any tracks at or above the maximum will be colored with the maximum color (red).

![My Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liamholtlab/napari-gemspa/main/screen_shots/5_10.png)

**Plots**

GEMspa will also output summary plots including:
* Ensemble average MSD shown on linear and log-scale with results from fitting the MSD vs time-lag data from the ensemble average MSD.
* Track length histogram, Radius of gyration (for full track lengths) histogram, Scatter plot of track length vs. radius of gyration

![My Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liamholtlab/napari-gemspa/main/screen_shots/5_7.png)

![My Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liamholtlab/napari-gemspa/main/screen_shots/5_8.png)

**Tracks data table**

GEMspa will output a table of data in a new pop-up window with data for each track.  This table will only show one line for each track (not one line for every particle position) and it will output the following data:
* track_id
* frame_start
* frame_end
* radius_gyration: radius of gyration for the full track length (See [Elliot et al](https://doi.org/10.1039/c0cp01805h))
* track_length
* D: effective diffusion coefficient
* E: y-intercept for the fit of MSD for D
* r_sq (lin): R-squared value for goodness-of-fit for the fit of MSD vs time-lag
* K: generalized diffusion coefficient
* a: anomalous exponent (alpha)
* r_sq (log): R-squared value for goodness-of-fit for the fit of log-log MSD vs. time-lag

![My Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/liamholtlab/napari-gemspa/main/screen_shots/5_9.png)

**New tracks layer**

GEMspa will add a new tracks layer and save all data for each track in the properties of the tracks layer.  Save the tracks layer to obtain a tab/comma-delimited text file with all analysis results.  The data included for each track is:
* track_id
* frame
* y: y position in pixels
* x: x position in pixels
* frame_start
* frame_end
* y (microns): y position in microns
* x (microns): x position in microns
* tau: time-lag in seconds
* MSD: mean squared displacement 
* t: time in seconds from start of track
* step_size
* radius_gyration: radius of gyration at each time point of track (See [Elliot et al](https://doi.org/10.1039/c0cp01805h))
* track_length
* D: effective diffusion coefficient
* E: y-intercept for the fit of MSD for D
* r_sq (lin): R-squared value for goodness-of-fit for the fit of MSD vs time-lag
* K: generalized diffusion coefficient
* a: anomalous exponent (alpha)
* r_sq (log): R-squared value for goodness-of-fit for the fit of log-log MSD vs. time-lag

To extract this data, save the layer as a tab or comma delimited text file (txt/tsv/csv).  GEMspa will save all track information.

**Analysis for a single track**

GEMspa also provides the option to select a single track and output analysis results.  Detailed information is shown for the selected track, including a plot of the radius of gyration at each time point and a plot of the track itself.

A napari plugin to simulate raw-image stacks of Structured illumination microscopy (SIM). 

The simulation is originally based on the paper <strong>GPU-accelerated real-time reconstruction in Python of three-dimensional datasets from structured illumination microscopy with hexagonal patterns</strong> by
Hai Gong, Wenjun Guo and Mark A. A. Neil (https://doi.org/10.1098/rsta.2020.0162). 

The calculation can be GPU-accelerated if the CUPY (tested with cupy-cuda11x) is installed. In addition, the TORCH package can complete the acceleration both on CPU if TORCH is installed, and on GPU if TORCH is compiled with the CUDA (tested with torch v1.13.1+cu117) enabled.

Currently applies to:
- conventional 2-beam SIM data with 3 angles and 3 phases
- 3-beam hexagonal SIM data with 7 phases, as described in the paper
- 3-beam hexagonal SIM data with 5 phases at right-angles
- conventional 3-beam 3-D data with 3 angles and 5 phases

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/plugins/index.html
-->

## Installation

You can install `napari-generic-SIMulator` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-generic-SIMulator



To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/Meizhu-Liang/napari-generic-SIMulator.git

This plugin is compatible with **napari 0.4.17** or above, older versions of napari would show errors in _interpolation_.

## Usage

1) Open napari and create the viewer.


2) Launch two widgets: **Point cloud generator** and **SIM data generator** in ***Plugin***.

   ![raw](https://github.com/Meizhu-Liang/napari-generic-SIMulator/raw/main/images/lauch.png)

   The two widgets can be tabbed together.
   ![raw](https://github.com/Meizhu-Liang/napari-generic-SIMulator/raw/main/images/2tabs.png)


3) Choose the type and other parameters of point cloud as a sample in **Point cloud generator**.

    ![raw](https://github.com/Meizhu-Liang/napari-generic-SIMulator/raw/main/images/pc.png)

    The point cloud can be displayed in three dimensions, and be saved and loaded as .pcd files.
  
    https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74197598/227589232-9006842b-6706-48b7-9f2b-fe93c6698503.mp4


4) Adjust parameters in SIM data generator to simulate a raw image stack.

   Apart from basic parameters such as the refractive index, the wavelengths and so on, the z scanning can be either 
   **z drift**: the conventional SIM (imaging a raw stack at the same z-position) or **z step**: the drifting case in 
   the papaer mentioned above (imaging only one raw image at a z-position).


   ![raw](https://github.com/Meizhu-Liang/napari-generic-SIMulator/raw/main/images/raw_stack.png)

   The parameters used in the simulation can be saved with the image stack by clicking **save tif with tags**. Tags (of current or of one stack dragged into napari viewer) can be printed in Python by **print tags**. 


5) Three-dimensional point spread function (**PSF**), optical transfer function (**OTF**) and **illumination** patterns applied in the simulation can be showed by buttons. Note the all of these correspond the generated raw-image stack, so keep the parameters the same before showing the **PSF** (or **OTF** and **illumination**).

A file reader plugin for napari


It opens simple *.h5 files. Reads all Datasets inside the file and converts to
a napari Image object (np.array).

It can also save ""image"" or ""labels"" data. Note that these will be saved individually.

It does not support data organised internally in ""groups"".
For these more complicated h5 data structures please try other plugins.

napari plugin to store napari projects in a .h5 file. Label layer are stored in a sparse representation (COO list).

-->

## Description

This napari plugin provides a writer and reader to store existing layers in the current napari window, all the metadata is stored as well in a HDF5 file. All the stored preferences are included when a project file is opened.

Label layers are stored in a coordinate list sparse representation with the [Sparse module](https://sparse.pydata.org/) to keep the project file size minimum when possible (aiming to implement this in other layers in the future).

## HDF5 file architecture

The project file is a HDF5 generated with the [h5py module](https://docs.h5py.org). The file groups correspond to the different napari layer types and the layer metadata is stored as attributes of each layer.

In the case of the meta dictionary which is nested in the LayerData meta dictionary (napari IO), new keys are generated in the outer dictionary to use them as h5 dataset attributes. This nested dictionary architecture is reconstructed by the reader to ensure format compatibility.

## Installation

You can install `napari-hdf5-labels-io` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-hdf5-labels-io

Pipeline between [`napari`](https://github.com/napari/napari) and [`himena`](https://github.com/hanjinliu/himena).

`napari` is a great tool for visualization, annotation and analysis of multi-dimensional
images. On the other hand, `himena` has a powerful plugin system that allows users to
technically do anything, such as editing table and plotting.

`napari-himena` connects these two ecosystems together, enabling users to send data
back and forth, extending the functionality of the both packages.

## Examples

#### 1. Sending image layers to `himena` for ImageJ-like multi-measurement and Excel-like plotting.

Measuring time-course change in the image intensity with [`himena-image`](https://github.com/hanjinliu/himena-image) plugin, and plot the result using the built-in plot functions using `matplotlib`.

![](https://github.com/hanjinliu/napari-himena/blob/main/assets/image-plot.gif)

#### 2. Sending points and their features to `himena` for seaborn plotting.

Feature dataframe can be directly sent to `himena` for `seaborn` plotting using [`himena-seaborn`](https://github.com/hanjinliu/himena-seaborn) plugin.

![](https://github.com/hanjinliu/napari-himena/blob/main/assets/feature-sns.gif)

## Usage

#### Starting from `napari`

Open the `napari-himena` dock widget from the ""Plugin"" menu, connect to one of the
`himena` profile (only ""default"" is available by default), and that's it!

![](https://github.com/hanjinliu/napari-himena/blob/main/assets/from-napari.png)

#### Starting from `himena`

To use this plugin from `himena`, you need to first register this plugin to the `himena`
profile

```shell
# install to the default profile
himena --install napari-himena

# or install to a specific profile
himena <my-profile> --install napari-himena
```

Then all the commands will be available in `himena` and a napari viewer will be launched
when it is needed. You don't need to do this if you always launch `himena` from `napari`
plugin; it automatically register this package in the beginning.

Hierarchical file format support for napari

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.


## Installation

You can install `napari-hierarchical` via [pip]:

    pip install ""napari-hierarchical[all]""

To install latest development version :

    pip install ""git+https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/napari-hierarchical.git#egg=napari-hierarchical[all]""

## Usage

The plugin enables the reading, editing and writing of container formats. In the plugin, *groups* represent hierarchically structured collections of *arrays*. Each group can hold zero or more arrays and can have zero or more child groups (hierarchical structure). An array is a logical representation of (image) data on disk and directly corresponds to a napari layer when loaded.

Files can be opened through napari (e.g. `File -> Open File(s)` menu, `Viewer.open(...)` function), as the plugin implements napari's file reader hook. Upon opening a hierarchically structured file, the *Groups* and *Arrays* widgets are displayed. The *Groups* widget allows to browse and restructure the groups tree, while the *Arrays* widget groups arrays from the selected groups by file format-specific metadata (e.g. channel name for MCD files). Selecting arrays also selects the corresponding napari layers, allowing to adjust their properties.

Arrays can be loaded individually by toggling their *loaded* state (circular button), which will add napari layers for the corresponding arrays. Similarly, loaded arrays can be shown or hidden by toggling their *visible* state (eye button), which will toggle the visibility of the associated napari layers. The loaded/visible states of groups (collections of arrays) can be toggled in a similar fashion. Arrays are always loaded into memory (no memory mapping), to allow for editing the tree structure. Loaded root groups can be exported to supported hierarchical file formats.

Currently, reading/writing of HDF5 and Zarr (not: OME-NGFF) files are supported out of the box, as well as reading imaging mass cytometry (IMC) data (i.e., MCD files). For these file formats, sample data is available through the plugin. Additional readers/writers can be implemented using a pluggy-based interface, similar to the first generation `napari-plugin-engine`.

**napari-imagej** aims to provide access to all [ImageJ2] functionality through the [napari] graphical user interface. It builds on the foundation of [PyImageJ], a project allowing ImageJ2 access from Python.

**With napari-imagej, you can access:**

1. The napari-imagej widget, providing *headless access* to:
   * [ImageJ2 Commands] - 100+ image processing algorithms
   * [ImageJ Ops] - 500+ *functional* image processing algorithms
   * [SciJava Scripts] - migrated from Fiji or ImageJ2, or written yourself!
2. The ImageJ user interface, providing access to *the entire ImageJ ecosystem* within napari.

See the [project roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/imagej/projects/2) for future directions.

# Description

This plugin enables viewing of Bitplane Imaris files, including very large datasets.  The GIFs below demonstrate rendering of a ~2TB IMS file containing a 2 color whole mouse brain.  The plugin has been tested on datasets as large as 20TB.

**NOTE: For this plugin to work ""File/Preferences/Experimental/Render Images Asynchronously"" must be selected.**

### Open IMS file:

![Open IMS file GIF](https://i.imgur.com/ByHb0wI.gif ""Open IMS file"")



### Render in 3D:

A plugin is provided to dynamically reload the data after selecting the lowest resolution level to be included in the viewer.  Since napari only renders the lowest resolution, the user can use this plugin to control the quality of 3D rendering.  See features and limitations for tips on suggested usage.

![3D Rendering and Quality Adjustment GIF](https://i.imgur.com/MZNlWtM.gif ""3D Rendering and Quality Adjustment"")

### Features

* Multiscale Rendering
  * Image pyramids which are present in the native IMS format are automatically added to napari during file loading.
* Chunks are implemented by dask and matched to the chunk sizes stored in each dataset.  (Napari appears to only ask for 2D chunks - unclear how helpful this feature is currently)
* Successfully handles multi-terabyte multi-timepoint multi-channel datasets.
* Tested with all sample files provided by Bitplane.
* Higher 3D rendering quality is enabled by a widget that reloads data after specifying the lowest resolution level (higher number = lower resolution) to be included in the multiscale series.

### Known Issues / limitations

* Currently, this is **only an image loader**, and there are no features for loading or viewing objects
* Napari sometimes throws errors indicating that it expected a 3D or 5D array but receives the other.
  * This sometimes *but relatively rarely* causes napari to crash
  * Would like to enable Asynchronous Tiling of Images, but this results in more instability and causes crashes.

## Installation

You can install `napari-imaris-loader` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-imaris-loader

## Change Log:

##### <u>v0.1.2:</u>

**Fixed:** Issue where .ims files containing a single color 2D image would not open.

**Fixed:** Issue where using the widget to change resolutions while in 3D rendering would cause a crash.  Now the viewer is automatically forced into 2D rendering mode when the widget is used.

**Dependency change:** The loader is now dependent in a separate package for loading IMS files.  https://pypi.org/project/imaris-ims-file-reader/

**v0.1.3:**

Documentation

**v0.1.4:**

Add napari to install requirements for plugin compatibility

**v0.1.5:**

Changes to napari:

- now requires napari[all] upon install.
- requires >=v0.1.5 of imaris-ims-file-reader

**v0.1.6:**

- Fix issue #7 where contrastLimits possibly unbound in reader

**v0.1.7:**

- For squeeze_output=False when opening .ims file for Napari compatibility

**v0.1.8:**

- Add automatic determination of contrast_limits
- Fix bug in squeeze_output

[napari] plugin to perform MALDI IMS - microscopy registration using laser ablation marks as described in [Anal. Chem. 2018, 90, 21, 12395–12403](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.analchem.8b02884). This plugin is a work-in-progress but is mostly functional.

__N.B.__ This tool is __NOT__ a general purpose registration framework to find transforms between IMS (MALDI or otherwise)
and microscopy. It is built to align MALDI IMS pixels to their corresponding laser ablation marks as captured by microscopy AFTER the IMS experiment. 
This approach has the advantage of providing direct evidence of registration performance as IMS pixels are aligned 
to their _explicit spatial origin_ in microscopy space, improving overall accuracy and confidence of microscopy-driven IMS 
data analysis.

## Installation

You can install `napari-imsmicrolink` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-imsmicrolink

### Typical experiment workflow
1. Acquire pre-IMS microscopy (autofluorescence, brightfield) - _optional_
2. Perform normal IMS sample preparation.
3. Acquire post-IMS microscopy (autofluorescence, brightfield) with matrix still on sample
that reveals laser ablation marks.

4. Gather IMS data that contains XY integer coordinates for the IMS experiment
   (.imzML, Bruker spotlist (.txt, .csv), Bruker peaks.sqlite (_FTICR_),
   Bruker .tsf (TIMS qTOF only))

5. Run `napari-imsmicrolink` with data 3 and 4

6. Once registered, use `wsireg` to align other microscopy modalities to IMS-registered post-IMS
microscopy

Emmanuella OKAFOR (L3 PA CMI-PSI_Université d'Angers) developed this plugin during her internship with a french team called ImHorPHen (lead by David ROUSSEAU). This plugin realises vegetation indexes computation with hyperspectral images. For the momment, there are five vegetation indexes : NDVI, TCARI, NPCI, SGI, NDGI.
## Installation

You can install `napari-indices` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-indices



To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/Emmanulla0/napari-indices.git

## Plugin description


Using this plugin requires importing the bands of a hyperspectral image into a **tif file**, in our case, 160 bands. You must launch it by accessing the **Plugins > napari-indices> Vegetation indices** menu.

![Capture d'écran 2023-05-29 124720](https://github.com/Emmanuella0/napari-indices/assets/132358490/3b3895df-d0a7-466e-8ada-92bd4b642852)

Then select the vegetation index to be calculated and the different bands to be used, then click the **Run** button to start the calculation. This results in the images corresponding to the calculated indices.

![etape_2](https://github.com/Emmanuella0/napari-indices/assets/132358490/4875f0fc-3435-4875-ba4e-8881cb179b96)


The areas of interest to be analysed must then be defined. To do this, click the **Shapes** button on the Napari interface and choose the **add rectangle** shape from the menu that appears. Using the mouse, it is then possible to draw a rectangle on each of the two areas to be analyzed, for example a tree sheet and a green sheet of paper. 

![etape_3](https://github.com/Emmanuella0/napari-indices/assets/132358490/fc8612fe-5deb-4290-b4c3-9cac20acf1ce)


To perform the Fisher ratio calculation and display the histogram, it is necessary to go back to the **Plugins > napari-indices > ExempleQWidget** menu and click the **Click me! **. This action opens a new window displaying the best vegetation index to use, its corresponding Fisher ratio and the histogram of the two selected regions on the image of the vegetation index concerned. A video explaining the plugin is available at: https://uabox.univ-angers.fr/index.php/s/LqB0qs11n3jxZVJ.

# napari-intensity-plotter

**napari-intensity-plotter** is a plugin for **[napari](https://napari.org)** that provides tools to measure and plot intensity profiles in 2D time-series images.

![Intensity Plot Widget](images/intensity_plot_widget_example.png)

*Screenshot: Intensity profile of a region of interest in a 2D time-series image.*

## Features

- **Intensity Plot Widget**: Allows you to select a region of interest in a 2D time-series image and plot the intensity profile over time.
- **Intensity Plot Control Widget**: Lets you fine-tune plot parameters and save the results as CSV or PNG files.

## Installation

You can install `napari-intensity-plotter` via pip:

```bash
pip install napari-intensity-plotter
```

Alternatively, you can install it directly from the napari plugin interface.

### Usage

1. **Load a 2D Time-Series Image**  
   Load a 2D time-series image (e.g., fluorescence microscopy data) in napari.

2. **Activate the Widgets**  
   Open the `Intensity Plot Widget` and `Intensity Plot Control Widget` from the `Plugins` menu in napari.

3. **Intensity Plot Widget**  
   - Move your mouse over the image, or click on a specific location to plot the intensity profile of the selected region across slices (e.g., time).
   - The region of interest (ROI) size can be adjusted using the square size setting in the control widget.

4. **Intensity Plot Control Widget**  
   - Configure the square size for the ROI (ensures that the region size remains odd).
   - Set the directory to save plots and intensity data.
   - Save the intensity profile as a `.csv` or `.png` file by clicking the corresponding buttons or using keyboard shortcuts (`Ctrl+S`).

5. **Additional Controls**  
   - Hide all layers using the `Hide All Layers` button or `Ctrl+D`.
   - Use the rectangle to visualize the selected ROI.

### Example Workflow

**Step 1**: Load a 2D time-series image (e.g., `tif` or `nd2`) into napari. Ensure the layer is visible.

**Step 2**: Open the `Intensity Plot Widget` to visualize intensity changes over time or slices for a specific ROI.

**Step 3**: Use the `Intensity Plot Control Widget` to:
- Adjust the square size for the ROI.
- Specify a directory to save intensity data.
- Enable saving in CSV or PNG formats.
  
**Step 4**: Save the plotted intensity data by clicking `Save to CSV/PNG` or pressing `Ctrl+S`.

**Step 5**: Hide all layers if necessary using `Hide All Layers` or `Ctrl+D`.

## Installation

You can install `napari-ISM` via [PyPI]:

    pip install napari-ISM
    
or by using [napari hub].

It requires the following Python packages

    numpy
    scipy
    h5py
    PyQt5
    brighteyes-ism>=1.2.0

## Documentation

To generate a simulated dataset, go to `File > Open Sample > ISM dataset`. 

![](https://github.com/VicidominiLab/napari-ISM/raw/main/docs/sample.png)

To acces the plugin list, go to `Plugins > Napari-ISM`.

![](https://github.com/VicidominiLab/napari-ISM/raw/main/docs/plugin_list.png)

To open a .h5 file, go to `File > Open `.
You can then sum over the dimensions that are not needed, using the command `integrateDims`.
The default axes are 0 (repetition), 1 (axial position), and 4 (time).

![](https://github.com/VicidominiLab/napari-ISM/raw/main/docs/file.png)

Note that all the analysis commands expect an input with size `X x Y X Ch`.

To see the result of summing over the SPAD dimensions `Ch`, use the plugin command `Sum`. Then, press `Run`.

![](https://github.com/VicidominiLab/napari-ISM/raw/main/docs/sum.png)

To see the result of Adaptive Pixel Reassignment, use the plugin command `APR_stack`.
Select as reference image (`ref`) the central one. Select an upsampling factor (`usf`), 
which corresponds to the sub-pixel precision of the shift-vector estimation. Then, press `Run`.

![](https://github.com/VicidominiLab/napari-ISM/raw/main/docs/apr.png)

To generate the PSFs, use the plugin command `PSFs`. Select an image layer (`img layer`), 
it will be used to determine the number of pixels and the pixel size.
Then, select the detector pixel size (`pxsize`) and pixel pitch (`pxpitch`) in microns.
Select the magnification of the system (`M`). Select the excitation (`exWl`) and emission wavelength (`emWl`) in nanometers.
Then, press `Run`.

![](https://github.com/VicidominiLab/napari-ISM/raw/main/docs/PSF.png)

To see the result of multi-image deconvolution, use the plugin command `Deconvolution`.
Select an image layer (`img layer`) containing the ISM dataset to deconvolve and another image layer (`psf layer`) containing the PSFs, either simulated or experimental.
Then, press `Run`.

![](https://github.com/VicidominiLab/napari-ISM/raw/main/docs/deconv.png)

To use Focus-ISM, first select a region on the input dataset using a `shapes` layer.
Select a rectangle containing mainly in-focus emitters. It will be used as a calibration.
Then, use the plugin command `Focus-ISM`. Select an image layer (`img layer`) containing the ISM dataset and a shape layer (`shape layer`) defining the calibration region.
Select a lower bound for the standard deviation of the out-of-focus curve (`sigma B bound`) in units of standard deviations of the in-focus term. We suggest to never select a value below 2.
Select a threshold (`threshold`) in units of photon counts. Scan coordinates with less photons than the threshold will be skipped in the analysis and classified as background. Then, press `Run`.

![](https://github.com/VicidominiLab/napari-ISM/raw/main/docs/shapes.png)

To use FRC, prepare the dataset to be in the shape `xyt`.
Select the theshodling method (`method`) and smoothing method (`smoothing`) among those available.
Then, press `Calculate`.

<h2>About this plugin</h2>


This Napari plugin was designed for the detection and quantification of periodic biological structures.
As this plugin has not been uploaded to napari-hub as of this moment it **cannot be installed on a pre-compiled, bundled 
version of Napari**. Therefore Napari will need to be installed as a python package 
(<a href=""https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/fundamentals/installation.html"">more info about Napari installation</a>). 
Further information about the installation and licensing of the plugin can be found below. A detailed manual on the usage of the plugin can be found below as well. 

**If you have any questions or need help with the installation, please do hesitate to use the issues tab.**

**In case you need a tutorial on how to use the plugin, please use the ""tutorial request"" label in the issues tab to reach out to me:**


<h3>Guide</h3>

Actin is the most abundant protein in eukaryotic cells. As it is part of the cytoskeleton its function is essential for 
the maintenance of the cell's morphological structure. In neurons, it was only recently that researchers started paying 
attention to the peculiar subcellular organization and localization of actin. First focussing on the dendritic spines, 
later expanding to the axon.  

The axon initial segment (AIS) is defined as the most proximal 30-60 µm of the axon and is known for its sturdy 
actin-betaIV cytoskeletal structure which is known to facilitate the densely packed ion channels, regulatory and
scaffolding proteins on the membrane. The recent popularity of superresolution microscopy techniques like STORM and STED
has made the study of the localization of these proteins relatively easy and straightforward.

&nbsp;
<p align=""center"">
    <img src=""static/Figure 1.svg"" width=""100%"">
</p>
&nbsp;

Because of this property of the AIS many ion channels are localized either perpendicular to the actin rings
or attached to a scaffolding protein called Ankyrin G which is localized in between two actin rings. This results in ion 
channels like the Kv 1.1 (displayed below) appearing similar to superresolution images of actin.

This plugin was designed to detect and quantify the distance and the goodness of periodicity between cellular periodic structures. 
Additionally, it can be used to detect and quantify the periodicity shift between two periodic stuctures.

`napari-kld` is a `napari` plugin that implements kernel learning deconvolution algrotihm.

## **Kernel Learning Deconvolution (KLD)**

KLD is a rapid deconvolution algorithm for fluorescence microscopic image, which learns the forward and backward kernels in Richardson-Lucy Deconvolution (RLD) from paired low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) images.

It only requires **one sample** to training the model, and **two iterations** to achieve a superior deconvolution performance compared to RLD and its variants using unmatched backward projection.

**This [napari] plugin was generated with [copier] using the [napari-plugin-template].*

## **Installation**

You must install `napari` firstly and then install `napari-kld`.

### **Install `napari`**

You can download the `napari` bundled app for a simple installation via https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/fundamentals/quick_start.html#installation.

Or, you can install `napari` with Python using pip:

```
conda create -y -n napari-env -c conda-forge python=3.10
conda activate napari-env
python -m pip install 'napari[all]'
```

Refer to https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/fundamentals/quick_start.html#installation.

### **Install `napari-kld`**

You can install `napari-kld` plugin with `napari`:

`Plugins` > `Install/Uninstall Plugins…` > [search napari-kld] > `install`.


Or you can install `napari-kld` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-kld

## **Instruction**
This plugin includes two part:

- `RL Deconvolution` : Conventional RLD algorithm using different type of backward kernels (including matched backward kernel [`Traditional`] and unmatched backward kernels [`Guassian`, `Butterworth`, `Wiener-Butterworth (WB)`]). The forward kernel, i.e., point spread function (PSF), is required.

- `KL Deconvolution` : KLD using learned forward/backward kernels.

**You can download the `""test""` folder  at https://github.com/qiqi-lu/kernel-learning-deconvolution for testing, which save some 2D/3D images used for training and testing.**

## **RL Deconvolution**

The conventional RLD using different type of backward kernels.

1. Open `napari` and load `napari-kld` plugin: `Plugins` > `Kernel Learning Deconvolution` > `RL Deconvolution`

2. Load input low-resolution (LR) image: `File` > `Open File(s)` > `[choose the image to be deconvolved]` > `[the image will appear in the layer list of napari]`, such as the simulated image `""test/data/simulation/data_128_128_128_gauss_0.0_poiss_0_ratio_1.0/train/raw/0.tif""`.

3. Choose the name of loaded image in `Input RAW data`, such as `""0""`.

4. Press `Choose` to choose a `PSF` correspongding to the loaded image, such as `""test/data/simulation/data_128_128_128_gauss_0.0_poiss_0_ratio_1.0/train/psf.tif""`.

5. Choose the type of backward kernel in `Method` combo box:

    - `Traditional` : the backward kernel is just the flip of forward kernel (i.e., PSF).
    - `Guassian` : Guassian-shaped backward kernel, thw FWHM of which is same as the forward kernel.
    - `Butterworth` : Butterworth-shaped backward kernel, which is constructed using Butterworth filter.
    - `WB` : WB-shaped backward kernel, which is constructed by combining Wiener and Butterworth filter.

6. Set the number of RL iterations `Iterations` and parameters of backward kernel*.

7. Press `run` button to do deconvolution.

8. Wait the `progress bar` to reach 100%.

9. The output deconved image will appear in the layer list named as `{name of input image}_deconv_{Method}_iter_{Iterations}`, such as `""0_deconv_traditional_iter_30""`.

**The adjustment of parameters of backward kernels should refer to the paper : Guo, M. et al. Rapid image deconvolution and multiview fusion for optical microscopy. Nat Biotechnol 38, 1337–1346 (2020).*

## **KL Deconvolution**

### **Training data preparation**

The data used for training must be prepared in a folder consisting of:

- A folder named `""gt""` (optional) , such as `""test/data/real/2D/train/gt""`, which saves all the GT images (only support .tif file).
- A folder named `""raw""`, such as `""test/data/real/2D/train/raw""`, which saves all the LR images (only support .tif file). The file names must be the same as those in `""gt""` folder.
- A file named `""train.txt""`, such as `""test/data/real/2D/train/train.txt""`, which saves the name of each image in `""gt""/""raw""` filder in each line.

### **When yuo have paired LR image and HR image**

When we have paired LR image and HR image, we can treat LR image as **raw input** and HR image as **ground truth** (GT). We can first learn the forward kernel and then learn the backward kernel in a **supervised strategy**.

#### **Training of Forward Projection**

Train the forward projection to learn forward kernel.

1. Open `napari` and load `napari-kld` plugin: `Plugins` > `Kernel Learning Deconvolution` > `KL Deconvolution`

2. Choose `Training` tab.

3. Choose `Data Directory`, such as `""test/data/real/2D/train""`. Then the dimention of training data will show in the `Dimension` box.

4. Choose `Output Directory`, such as `""test/data/real/2D""`.

5. `PSF Directory` is not required as the PSF is unknown.

6. If the raw input and GT image have different intensity, please check the `Preprocess` check box, which will rescale the input and GT images to have the same intensity. Here, do not check.

7. In the `Forward Projection` box, set the parameters of training:
    - `Epoch` : number of epochs of training.
    - `Batch Size` : batch size of training data used during training.
    - `Kernel Size (z, xy)` : the size of forward kernel to learned.
    - `Optimizer` : the optimization algorithm. Default: Adam.
    - `Learning Rate` : learning rate of training.
    - `Decay Step` ： the decay step of learning rate. Note: `0` for no decay.
    - `Decay Rate` : the decay rate of learning rate.

8. Press `run` button. You can press the `stop` button to end the training.

9. Wait the `progress bar` to reach 100% and training finished.

After the training of forward projection, the results will be save in the `/checkpoints` folder in `Output Directory`, the model was named as `forward_bs_{batch size}_lr_{learning rate}_ks_{kernel size (z)}_{kernel size (xy)}`, such as `""test/data/real/2D/checkpoints/forward_bs_1_lr_0.001_ks_1_31""`, which consists of:
- a `log` folder saved the `Tensorboard` log, which can be opened with `Tensorboard`.
- many model checkpoints, named as `epoch_{epoch}.pt`.
- a `parameters.json` file saving the parameters used to training the model.

#### **Training of Backward Projection**

After training of forward projeciton, we can freeze the forward projeciton and then train the backward projeciton.

1. Open `napari` and load `napari-kld` plugin: `Plugins` > `Kernel Learning Deconvolution` > `KL Deconvolution`

2. Choose `Training` tab.

3. Choose `Data Directory`, such as `""test/data/2D/real/train""`. Then the dimention of training data will show in the `Dimension` box.

4. Choose `Output Directory`, such as `""test/data/2D/real""`.

5. `PSF Directory` is no required as the PSF is unknown.

6. If the raw input and GT image have different intensity, please check the `Preprocess` check box, which will rescale the input and GT images to have the same intensity. Here, do not check.

7. In the `Backward Projeciton` box, set parameters for the trianing of backward projeciton.

    - `Training strategy` : `supervised` training or `self-supervised` training. Here, set as `supervised`, as we have the GT images. When choosing the `self-supervised` mode, a PSF is required.
    - `Iterations (RL)` : The number of iterations of RL iterative procedure. Default: 2.
    - `Epoch` : The number fo epochs used to traing the model.
    - `Batch Size` : The batch size used to training the model.
    - `Kernel Size (z, xy)`: The size of backward kernel, `x` and `y` have the same size.
    - `FP directory` : the directory of the pre-trained forward projeciton model, such as `""test/data/real/2D/checkpoints/forward_bs_1_lr_0.001_ks_1_31/epoch_500_final.pt""` (commonly the model labeled with `""_final""` is used).
    - `Optimizer` : Optimization algorithm. Default: Adam.
    - `Learning Rate` : The learning rate used to trianing the model.
    - `Decay Step` : the decay step of learning rate.
    - `Decay Rate` : the decay rate of learning rate.

8. Press `run` button. You can press the `stop` button to end the training.

9. Wait the `progress bar` to reach 100% and then the training finishes.

When the training finishes, the results will be save in the `/checkpoints` folder in `Output Directory`, the model was named as `backward_bs_{batch size}_lr_{learning rate}_iter_{num of RL iterations}_ks_{kernel size (z)}_{kernel size (xy)}`, such as `""test/data/real/2D/checkpoints/backward_bs_1_lr_1e-05_iter_2_ks_1_31""`, which consists of:

- a `log` folder saved the `Tensorboard` log, which can be opened with `Tensorboard`.
- many model checkpoints, named as `epoch_{epoch}.pt`.
- a `parameters.json` file saving the parameters used to training the model.

Now we get the learned forward projection and backward projection.

Next, we can use them to do `Prediction`.

### **When you only have a PSF**

When you only have a PSF to do deconvolution, you can train the model using simulated data following the below steps:

1. Generate simulaiton data.
2. Train the model under supervised mode.
3. Apply the trained model on real data.

#### **Simulation data generation**

1. Open `napari` and load `napari-kld` plugin: `Plugins` > `Kernel Learning Deconvolution` > `KL Deconvolution`

2. Choose `Simulation` tab.

3. Choose the `Output Directory` of the generated simulation data, such as `""test\data\simulation""`.

4. Choose the `PSF Directory` (only support 2D/3D PSF file save as .tif, axes = (y, x) or (z, y, x)), such as `""test\data\simulation\psf.tif""`.

5. Adjust the parameters as needed.
    - `Image Shape` : the shape of simulated image, when `z=1`, 2D image will be generated.
    - `PSF Crop` : when the input PSF is too large, you can crop the PSF to acuqire a smaller PSF. All the PSF will be converted to have an odd shape and normalized.
    - `Num of Simulations` : number of generated images.
    - `Gaussian (std)` : the standard deviation (std) of Gaussian noise added in the generated LR images. The mean of Gaussian noise = 0. Default: 0 (i.e., without gaussian noise).
    - `Poisson` : whether to add Poisson noise, if `True`, make the `Enable` checked.
    - `Ratio` : a ratio factor multiplied on GT image to control the level of Poisson noise, thus the simulated raw input LR image RAW can be expressed as:

    $$ RAW = Possion((GT \cdot Ratio)\times PSF) + Gaussian $$

    - `Scale Factor` : downsampling scale factor. Default: 1.

6. Press `run` button.

7. Wait the `progress bar` to reach 100%.

The generated simulation data will be save in `Output directory`, named as `""data_{shape_z}_{shape_y}_{shape_x}_gauss_{std of Gaussian noise}_poiss_{whether to add Poisson noise}_ratio_{Ratio}""`, such as: `""test\data\simulation\data_128_128_128_gauss_0.0_poiss_0_ratio_1.0\train""`

- `""data\train\gt""` saves the GT images which consist of structures with various shapes*.
- `""data\train\raw""` saves the RAW images with blur and noise.
- `""data\train\parameters.json""` is a dictionary of parameters used to generate the simulation data.
- `""data\train\psf.tif""` is the PSF used in the simulation data generation (as the original PSF may be cropped).
- `""data\train\train.txt` save all the image used to train the model.

After you generate simulation data, you can use them to train the model.

**the code was refered to the paper: Li, Y. et al. Incorporating the image formation process into deep learning improves network performance. Nat Methods 19, 1427–1437 (2022).*

*You may need to adjust the noise level in the image accordding to the real acuqired data.*

#### **Training with known PSF and simulated data**

The simulated data should be those generated using the known PSF.

1. Open `napari` and load `napari-kld` plugin: `Plugins` > `Kernel Learning Deconvolution` > `KL Deconvolution`

2. Choose `Training` tab.

3. Choose `Data Directory`, such as `test/data/simulation/data_128_128_128_gauss_0.0_poiss_0_ratio_1.0/train""`, which saves the data used to train the model in should include:
    - A `gt` folder saves the GT images
    - A `raw` folder save the raw input LR images with the same file name as GT images
    - A `train.txt` file saves all the file names used to train the model (does not need to list all the files in `gt`/`raw` folder but at least one).

4. Choose a `Output Directory` to save the model checkpoints, such as `""test/data/simulation/data_128_128_128_gauss_0.0_poiss_0_ratio_1.0""`.

5. Choose `PSF Directory` of the PSF corresponding to the data, such as `""test/data/simulation/data_128_128_128_gauss_0.0_poiss_0_ratio_1.0/train/psf.tif""`. Then the `Forward Projection` group box will be invisible as we do not need to learn the forward kernel when we know the PSF. Just use the PSF as the forward kernel.

6. If the raw input and GT image have different intensity, please check the `Preprocess` check box, which will rescale the input and GT images to have the same intensity. Here, do not check.

7. Then set parameters to learn the backward kernel.

    - `Training Strategy` : `supervised` training or `self-supervised` training. Here, set as `supervised`, as we have the GT images.
    - `Iterations (RL)` : the number of iterations of RL iteration procedure. Default: 2.
    - `Epoch` : the number fo epochs used to traing the model.
    - `Batch Size` : the batch size used to training the model.
    - `Kernel Size (z, xy)`: the size of backward kernel, `x` and `y` directions have the same size.
    - `FP Directory` : the directory of the forward projeciton model. Here, it is disabled as the PSF is known.
    - `Optimizer` : Optimization algorithm. Default: Adam.
    - `Learning Rate` : the learning rate used to trianing the model.
    - `Decay Step` : the decay step of learning rate.
    - `Decay Rate` : the decay rate of learning rate.

8. Press `run` button. You can press the `stop` button to end the training.

9. Wait the `progress bar` to reach 100% and the training finishes.

When the training finishes, a checkpoints folder will be created in `Output Directory` such as `""test/data/simulation/data_128_128_128_gauss_0.0_poiss_0_ratio_1.0/checkpoints""`.

The models is save in `/checkpoints` folder, which is named as `""backward_bs_{batch size}_lr_{learning rate}_iter_{num of RL iterations}_ks_{kernel size (z)}_{kernel size (xy)}""`, such as `""/checkpoints/backward_bs_1_lr_1e-06_iter_2_ks_1_31""`, consists of:

- A `log` folder saved the `Tensorboard` log, which can be open with `Tensorboard`.
- Many model checkpoints, named as `epoch_{epoch}.pt`.
- A `parameters.json` file saving the parameters used to training the model.

### **When you only have LR image and corresponding PSF**
When we only have LR image and its PSF, we can traing the backward projection through supervised training using simulation data as introduced above. The plugin also provide an alternative self-supervised training stratergy to learn the backward kernel.

1. Open `napari` and load `napari-kld` plugin: `Plugins` > `Kernel Learning Deconvolution` > `KL Deconvolution`

2. Choose `Training` tab.

3. Choose `Data Directory`, such as `""test/data/simulation/data_128_128_128_gauss_0.0_poiss_0_ratio_1.0/train""`.

4. choose `Output Directory`, such as `""test/data/simulation/data_128_128_128_gauss_0.0_poiss_0_ratio_1.0""`.

5. Choose `PSF Directory`, such as `""test/data/simulation/data_128_128_128_gauss_0.0_poiss_0_ratio_1.0/train/psf.tif""` then the `Forward Projection` box will be invisiable.

6. As there is no GT image, preprocessing is not needed. Do not check `Preprocess` check box.

7. In the `Backward Projeciton` box, set parameters for the trianing of backward projeciton.

    - `Training strategy` : `supervised` training or `self-supervised` training. Set as `self-supervised`, as we do not have the GT images.
    - `Iterations (RL)` : the number of iterations of RL iteration procedure. Default: 2.
    - `Epoch` : the number fo epochs used to traing the model.
    - `Batch Size` : the batch size used to training the model.
    - `Kernel Size (z, xy)`: the size of backward kernel, `x` and `y` directions have the same size.
    - `FP Directory` : the directory of the forward projeciton model. Here, it is disabled as the PSF is known.
    - `Optimizer` : Optimization algorithm. Default: Adam.
    - `Learning Rate` : the learning rate used to trianing the model.
    - `Decay Step` : the decay step of learning rate.
    - `Decay Rate` : the decay rate of learning rate.

8. Press `run` button. You can press the `stop` button to end the training.

9. Wait the `progress bar` to reach 100% and training finishes.

When the training finishes, the results will be save in the `/checkpoints` folder in `Output Directory`, the model was named as `backward_bs_{batch size}_lr_{learning rate}_iter_{num of RL iterations}_ks_{kernel size (z)}_{kernel size (xy)}_ss`, such as `""/checkpoints/backward_bs_1_lr_1e-05_iter_2_ks_31_31_ss""`, which consists of:

- a `log` folder saved the `Tensorboard` log, which can be opened with `Tensorboard`.
- many model checkpoints, named as `epoch_{epoch}.pt`.
- a `parameters.json` file saving the parameters used to training the model.

*The performance of self-supervised learning may be inferior to supervised learning according to our experiments.*

### **Prediction**
Use the learned forward/backward kernel to do deconvolution.

1. Open `napari` and load `napari-kld` plugin: `Plugins` > `Kernel Learning Deconvolution` > `KL Deconvolution`

2. Choose `Prediction` tab.

3. Load raw input low-resolution image through `napari`: `File` > `Open File(s)` > `[choose the image to be deconvolved]` > `[the image will appear in the layer list of napari]`, such as `""test/data/real/2D/test/raw/2.tif""`.

4. Choose the loaded image in `Input RAW data` box, e.g., `2`.

5. If the PSF is known, choose the `PSF directory`.

6. If the PSF is unknown, choose the `Forward Projection` directory, such as `""test/data/real/2D/checkpoints/forward_bs_1_lr_0.001_ks_1_31/epoch_500_final.pt""` (commonly the model labeled with `""_final""` is used). If both the directories of PSF and Forward Projeciton is choosen, KLD will directly use the PSF selected.

7. Choose the `Backward Projeciton` directory, such as `""test/data/real/2D/checkpoints/backward_bs_1_lr_1e-05_iter_2_ks_1_31/epoch_1000_final.pt""`  (commonly the model labeled with `""_final""` is used).

8. Set the number of RL iterations at `Iterations (RL)`. Default: 2.

9. Press run to do deconvolution.

10. Wait the progress bar to reach 100%.

The deconvolved image will be directly shown in the `layer list` of `napari`, named as `""{input data name}_deconvo_iter_{number of RL iterations}""`, e.g., `""16_deconv_iter_2""`. You can save it as needed.

### **Others**
The `log` tab print the message during running.
Press `clean` button will clean all the text in the `log` box.

### **Notice**

- *Currently, the plugin is runned on CPU. We have tried to run the training on GPU, but the training time did not decrease (maybe it is because the FFT-based covnlution was not optimized on GPU). We are trying to make improvements.*

- *The training time may be very long if we set the kernel size or the number of epoches too large, especially for 3D images. Besides, it also depends on the  computation capability of your device.*

A plugin to do image preprocessing, segmentation, and measurements on other images.  The typical workflow is background subtraction followed by smoothing, thresholding, and size filtering.  This is typically done on nuclear stained images.  Segmentation can optionally be followed by circular label expansion to find cytoplasmic signals. The labeled signals are then measured on background subtracted images.

##General organization

The code is separated into non-interactive processing functions (ipfunctions module) and an interactive widget (segwidget module).  Please look at the code on github for examples: [Github](https://github.com/jayunruh/napari-ip-workflow). The expected workflow is from jupyter notebooks with an interactive workflow shown in src/napari-ip-workflow/_tests/standard_segementation_widget.ipynb and a non-interactive workflow shown in src/napari-ip-workflow/_tests/standard_segmentation.ipynb.  The expectation is to find the best parameters in an interactive way (ideally testing on several images) and then use the non-interactive workflow to batch through more data sets.  All image processing algorithms are in the ipfunctions module and the segwidget module has the Napari widget code.  Below I describe the strategies that are utilized in the workflow.

## Background subtraction strategy

Automated background subtraction (e.g. as in Fiji) is often accomplished with a low pass filter-style approach like rolling ball background subtraction.  This approach fails as feature sizes grow larger or measurements approach the background.  Manual selection of the background is more robust but introduces human variability and isn't compatible with high throughput analyses.  Our approach is to attempt to automate regional selection of background as follows.  First the image is smoothed with a Gaussian filter to eliminate background noise.  Next, minimum values are subtracted from each channel and the resulting images are summed.   Next, a uniform 2D boxcar smoothing is applied to the image--background level regions in the resulting image are at least the boxcar size distance away from foreground objects.  The minimum pixel in that resulting image is a good approximation for the background region of the image.  A thick border is specified to avoid lower intensity regions at the border of the image.  This algorithm is implemented in the ipfunctions module as findBackground.  Once the background region is found, it can be measured with measureCirc.

## Segmentation and thresholding strategy

There are many automated thresholding algorithms available via python and, by extension, Napari.  This program uses a very simplistic but powerful method.  Most segmentable images consist of foreground and background components.  In imaging, the foreground is more noisy than the background.  Ideally a smoothed background subtracted image will have a maximum intensity that represents the foreground well and a background intensity of 0.  In that case, the threshold level can be easily defined as a fraction of that smoothed maximum intensity.  A threshold fraction of 0.25 tends to work well but lower values may be more robust if background is fairly smooth and the foreground is noisier.  In some cases the foreground has anomalous high values that will skew the estimation.  In that case it may be better to estimate the foreground as e.g. the 99th percentile of the intensity.  In some cases it may be useful to use the average intensity as a reference point instead or use the raw intensity value (statistic is Identity).  Those last options tend to be less robust and it may be desired in those cases to use some of the more complex autothresholding methods.  After thresholding, objects on the image edge are eliminated and objects are filtered according to size.  The minimum area can easy remove small debris that can contaminate a measurement.  The maximum area can be used for large contaminants or poorly segmented clusters of cells that might not be desired in the analysis.

A simple image-level annotation tool supporting multi-channel images for napari.

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

## Usage
Start the labeling tool from the menu `Utilities > label tool for classification`.   
First, click on the Choose directory button to open the folder selection window, and select the folder that contains the
 images you want to label and annotate.   
It will automatically list and display the images of tif, png, jpg, and bmp formats.
If you want to view the channels of a multi-channel image separately, check the split channels checkbox.
![](https://github.com/hiroalchem/napari-labelimg4classification/raw/main/docs/open.gif)

Initially, all channels will be opened in grayscale, but the pseudo-color and contrast adjustments you specified will be
 carried over when you open the next image.   
Thanks to napari, you can freely merge channels and turn them on and off.   
Label classes can be added, and can be removed by typing the same name as an already added class.
![](https://github.com/hiroalchem/napari-labelimg4classification/raw/main/docs/color_and_label.gif)


It will automatically save the labels.csv file with the image path and label, and the class.txt file with the class of the label.
![](https://github.com/hiroalchem/napari-labelimg4classification/raw/main/docs/class_and_labels.png)

If labels.csv and class.txt are already in the folder, they will be loaded and reflected automatically.

This is a napari-plugin based on the [labeling project].

It allows the generation of overlapping labels in one layer, save and load of this layer in a json-based file format and
it contains a widget to explore the overlapping labels layer and select specific segments with a mouse click .

Please note that currently, the widget part only works by adding it through code with:

    from napari_labeling import edit_widget
    viewer = napari.Viewer()
    viewer.window.add_dock_widget(edit_widget)

An example on how to achieve this can be found in the [main.py] on GitHub.

## Installation

To install this project :

    pip install napari['all']
    pip install git+https://github.com/nathandecaux/napari-labelprop.git

## Usage

Download [pretrained weights](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nathandecaux/napari-labelprop/main/pretrained.ckpt).

Open napari from terminal and start using functions from 'napari-labelprop' plugin (Under Plugins scrolling menu).

Available functions are :

- Inference : Propagate labels from trained weights (Pytorch checkpoint required)
- Training : Start training from scratch or from the pretrained weights.

PS : ""Unsupervised pretraining"" is not yet implemented. See CLI option at [LabelProp](https://github.com/nathandecaux/labelprop) repository.

Every operation is done in the main thread. So, napari is not responsive during training or inference, but you can still follow the progress in the terminal.

##### Training

To train a model, reach the plugin in the menu bar :

    Plugins > napari-labelprop > Training

Fill the fields with the following information :

- `Image` : Select a loaded napari.layers.Image layer to segment
- `Labels` : Select a loaded napari.layers.Labels layer with the initial labels
- `hints` : Select a loaded napari.layers.Labels layer with scribbled pseudo labels
- `Pretrained checkpoint` : Select a pretrained checkpoint from the server-side checkpoint directory
- `Slices shape` : Slices are resample to this shape for training and inference, then resampled to original shape. So far, slices must be squares.  
- `Propagation axis` : Set the axis to use for the propagation dimension
- `Max epochs` : Set the maximum number of epochs to train the model
- `Checkpoint output directory`
- `Checkpoint name`
- `Weighting criteria` : Defines the criteria used to weight each direction of propagation `ncc = normalized cross correlation (slow but smooth), distance = distance to the nearest label (fast but less accurate)`
- `Reduction` : When using ncc, defines the reduction to apply to the ncc map `mean / local_mean / none`. Default is `none`
- `Use GPU` : Set if whether to use the GPU or not. Default is `True` (GPU). GPU:0 is used by default. To use another GPU, set the `CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES` environment variable before launching napari.

##### Inference

To run inference on a model, reach the plugin in the menu bar :

    Plugins > napari-labelprop-remote > Inference

Fill the fields like in the training section. Then, click on the `Run` button.

create an overlap labels layer from two labels layers

## Description

This plugin takes two labels layers (layerA, layerB) as inputs, and generate the overlapped regions as a binary labels layer.
Three modes:<br>
(1) A_OR_B: new layer = layerA OR layerB (union)<br>
(2) A_AND_B: new layer = layerA AND layerB (intersection)<br>
(3) A_OUTSIDE_B: new layer = layerA OUTSIDE layerB (complement)<br>

[comment]: <need to update the gif>

Opens a socket to listen for commands to control napari from other processes.
This can be useful for controlling napari programmatically from other
applications, or for improving general OS integration (e.g. opening data from a
file or UrL in a running instance of napari).

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s
[cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

## Installation

You can install `napari-listener` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-listener

## Usage

Once installed, `napari-listener` can be started from the `napari > Plugins >
Start Listening` menu. You will see a new docked widget that displays the
address and port for the listener.

The listener is a TCP server that expects app-model command IDs. It will
execute any valid app-model command, but `napari-listener` registers its own
additional commands for demonstration purposes in
https://github.com/aganders3/napari-listener/blob/main/src/napari_listener/_actions.py.

You can test `napari-listener` using a TCP client such as
[netcat](https://linux.die.net/man/1/nc) or
[curl](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html) to send an app-model command (and
optional args). For example:

```shell
% nc 127.0.0.1 40256 <<< ""napari:open-file /path/to/local/file""
```

An experimental plugin to lazily load multiscale whole-slide tiff images with openslide and dask.

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using with [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

## Installation

**Step 1.)** Make sure you have OpenSlide installed. Download instructions [here](https://openslide.org/download/).

> NOTE: Installation on macOS is easiest via Homebrew: `brew install openslide`. Up-to-date and multiplatform 
> binaries for `openslide` are also avaiable via `conda`: `conda install -c sdvillal openslide-python`

**Step 2.)** Install `napari-lazy-openslide` via `pip`:

    pip install napari-lazy-openslide

## Usage

### Napari plugin

```bash
$ napari tumor_004.tif
```
By installing this package via `pip`, the plugin should be recognized by `napari`. The plugin
attempts to read image formats recognized by `openslide` that are multiscale 
(`openslide.OpenSlide.level_count > 1`). 

It should be noted that `napari-lazy-openslide` is experimental and has primarily 
been tested with `CAMELYON16` and `CAMELYON17` datasets, which can be 
downloaded [here](https://camelyon17.grand-challenge.org/Data/).

![Interactive deep zoom of whole-slide image](tumor_004.gif)


### Using `OpenSlideStore` with Zarr and Dask

The `OpenSlideStore` class wraps an `openslide.OpenSlide` object as a valid Zarr store. 
The underlying `openslide` image pyramid is translated to the Zarr multiscales extension,
where each level of the pyramid is a separate 3D `zarr.Array` with shape `(y, x, 4)`.

```python
import dask.array as da
import zarr

from napari_lazy_openslide import OpenSlideStore

store = OpenSlideStore('tumor_004.tif')
grp = zarr.open(store, mode=""r"")

# The OpenSlideStore implements the multiscales extension
# https://forum.image.sc/t/multiscale-arrays-v0-1/37930
datasets = grp.attrs[""multiscales""][0][""datasets""]

pyramid = [grp.get(d[""path""]) for d in datasets]
print(pyramid)
# [
#   <zarr.core.Array '/0' (23705, 29879, 4) uint8 read-only>,
#   <zarr.core.Array '/1' (5926, 7469, 4) uint8 read-only>,
#   <zarr.core.Array '/2' (2963, 3734, 4) uint8 read-only>,
# ]

pyramid = [da.from_zarr(store, component=d[""path""]) for d in datasets]
print(pyramid)
# [
#   dask.array<from-zarr, shape=(23705, 29879, 4), dtype=uint8, chunksize=(512, 512, 4), chunktype=numpy.ndarray>,
#   dask.array<from-zarr, shape=(5926, 7469, 4), dtype=uint8, chunksize=(512, 512, 4), chunktype=numpy.ndarray>,
#   dask.array<from-zarr, shape=(2963, 3734, 4), dtype=uint8, chunksize=(512, 512, 4), chunktype=numpy.ndarray>,
# ]

# Now you can use numpy-like indexing with openslide, reading data into memory lazily!
low_res = pyramid[-1][:]
region = pyramid[0][y_start:y_end, x_start:x_end]
```

Light field imaging plugin for napari

----------------------------------

Deconvolves a 4D light field image into a full 3D focus stack reconstruction

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/23206511/236919283-d53ca97a-9bdd-4598-b553-34996f688237.mp4

napari-LF contains an analytic and neural net analysis methods for light field images. To download example light field images, see our repository [napari-LF-docs-samples](https://github.com/PolarizedLightFieldMicroscopy/napari-LF-docs-samples).

### LF Analyze
**LF Analyze**, the analytic method, provides three basic processes to Calibrate, Rectify, and Deconvolve light field images:

The **Calibrate** process generates a calibration file that represents the optical setup that was used to record the light field images. The same calibration file can be used to rectify and deconvolve all light field images that were recorded with the same optical setup, usually the same microscope and light field camera. The Calibrate process requires as input the radiometry frame, dark frame, optical parameters, and volume parameters to generate the calibration file, which is subsequently used to rectify and deconvolve related light field images. The calibration file includes a point spread function (PSF) derived from the optical and volume parameters and is stored in HDF5 file format.

The **Rectify** process uses the calibration file for an affine transformation to scale and rotate experimental light field images that were recorded with a light field camera whose microlens array was (slightly) rotated with respect to the pixel array of the area detector and whose pixel pitch is not commensurate with the microlens pitch. After rectification, the rectified light field has the same integer number of pixels behind each microlens. When the Deconvolve process is called for an experimental light field image, rectifying the light field image is automatically applied before the iterative deconvolution does begin. However, the rectified light field image is not saved and is not available for viewing. Therefore, by pushing the Rectify button in the middle of the napari-LF widget, only the rectification step is invoked and the rectified light field image is saved to the project directory.

The **Deconvolve** process uses the PSF and a wave optics model to iteratively deconvolve a light field image into a stack of optical sections.

The **Parameter** panels, located in the lower half of the napari-LF widget, allows the user to specify settings for the reconstruction process. Once the appropriate parameters are selected, the Calibrate button followed by the Deconvolve button can be pushed to complete the reconstruction.

### Neural Net
**Neural Net** provides a method of applying a trained neural net model to deconvolve a light field image. Based on Pytorch Lightning and a provided [base class](https://github.com/PolarizedLightFieldMicroscopy/napari-LF/blob/main/src/napari_lf/lfa/neural_nets/LFNeuralNetworkProto.py), you can either create your own network, or use the pre-shipped networks (LFMNet, VCDNet, ...).

## Quickstart
1. Install the napari-LF plugin into your napari environment, as described below under **Installation**.
1. From the napari Plugins menu, select the napari-LF plugin to install its widget into the napari viewer.
### LF Analyze
1. Near the top of the widget, select your project folder containing the following images: light field, radiometry, and dark frame.
1. Calibration
    1. In the processing panel, navigate to **Calibrate, Required** (top tab **Calibrate**, bottom tab **Required**), which is the default selection.
    1. Select **radiometry** and **dark frame** images from pull down menus.
    1. Write the name of the **calibration file** you would like to produce, e.g. calibration.lfc.
    1. Enter the appropriate **optical parameters** according to your microscope and sample material.
    1. Enter the **volume parameters** you would like for your 3D reconstuction.
    1. Push the `Calibrate` button.
1. Deconvolution
    1. In the processing panel, navigate to **Deconvolve, Required**.
    1. Select **light field** image and **calibration file** from pull down menus.
    1. Write the name of the **output image stack** you would like to produce, e.g. output_stack.tif.
    1. Push the `Deconvolve` button.
The 3D focal stack reconstruction will display in the napari viewer and be saved in your original project folder.

### Neural Net
1. Click on the **LF Analyze** logo to toggle to the **Neural Net** mode.
1. Near the top of the widget, select your project folder containing the light field image and the trained neural net. If you do not already have a trained model, you can train a model using this [Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/PolarizedLightFieldMicroscopy/napari-LF/blob/main/src/napari_lf/lfa/main_train_neural_net.ipynb).
1. In the processing panel, select your **light field image** and **neural net model**.
1. Write the name of the **output image stack** you would like to produce, e.g. output_stack.tif.
1. Push the `Deconvolve` button.
The 3D focal stack reconstruction will display in the napari viewer and be saved in your original project folder.

## Getting Help
For details about each parameter, hover over each parameter textbox to read the tooltip description.
For additional information about the reconstruction process, see our [User Guide](docs/napari-LF_UserGuide_12May2023.pdf).

## Installation

After you have [napari] installed, you can one of the methods below to install `napari-LF`.

Method 1: You can install `napari-LF` via [pip]:

1. Select **Install** to install the light field plugin.

Method 3: Install the latest development version from the command line.

    pip install git+https://github.com/PolarizedLightFieldMicroscopy/napari-LF.git

Lastly, to access the installed plugin, open napari from the command line:

    napari

From the napari menu, select **Plugins > Main Menu (napari-LF)**. Note that you may need to close and reopen napari for the `napari-LF` to appear.

### Installation for developers

Create a virtual environment from the command line for napari with the python libraries necessary for the light field plugin:

    conda create -y -n napari-lf -c conda-forge python==3.9
    conda activate napari-lf

Clone the github repository:

    conda install git
    git clone https://github.com/PolarizedLightFieldMicroscopy/napari-LF.git
    cd napari-LF
    pip install -e .

The necessary dependencies should be installed automatically with `napari-LF`. If for some reason `pyopencl` does not get installed properly, try installing with conda:

    conda install -c conda-forge pyopencl

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using with [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

## Description

`napari-live-recording` (or `nlr`, if you like acronyms) is a <a href=""#why-medium-weight"">medium-weight</a> plugin part of the napari ecosystem that provides an easy 
access point for controlling area detector devices (most commonly reffered to as cameras) with a common interface.
Other than that, the plugin also allows to create computation pipelines that can be executed real-time in a flow starting directly from the camera stream.

> [!NOTE]
> 
> ### Why medium weight?
> `napari-live-recording` relies on multithreading to handle camera control,
> image processing and data storage via a common pipelined infrastructure.
> More details are provided in the documentation.

The plugin allows the following operations:

- snapping: capture a single image
- live view: continously acquiring from the currently active camera and show the collected data on the napari viewer;
- recording: stream data to disk from the currently active cameras

When recording, the plugin allows to store images according to the following formats:

- ImageJ TIFF
- OME-TIFF

> [!NOTE]
> Future releases will also add further file formats to the recording options, specifically:
> - HDF5
> - MP4
>
> We will also provide a method to add custom metadata to the recorded image files.

## Supported cameras

`napari-live-recording` aims to maintain itself agnostic for the type of cameras it controls. Via a common API (Application Programming Interface),
it possible to define a controller for a specific camera. Instructions
on how to do so are provided in the documentation.

By default, the plugin is shipped with the following interfaces:

- an [OpenCV](./src/napari_live_recording/control/devices/opencv.py) camera grabber;
- a [Micro-Manager](./src/napari_live_recording/control/devices/micro_manager.py) interface via the package [`pymmcore-plus`](https://pypi.org/project/pymmcore-plus/);
- an interface to the [microscope](./src/napari_live_recording/control/devices/pymicroscope.py) python package.

## Documentation

To install and use the plugin you can review the documentation [here](./docs/documentation.md).

## Contributing

<img src=""https://github.com/GuignardLab/tapenade/blob/main/imgs/tapenade3.png"" width=""100"">

A plugin to obtain parameters for affine transform used to register two views of the same object, e.g as obtained with dual-view microscopes. 

`napari-manual-registration` is a [napari] plugin that is part of the [Tapenade](https://github.com/GuignardLab/tapenade) project. Tapenade is a tool for the analysis of dense 3D tissues acquired with deep imaging microscopy. It is designed to be user-friendly and to provide a comprehensive analysis of the data.

If you use this plugin for your research, please [cite us](https://github.com/GuignardLab/tapenade/blob/main/README.md#how-to-cite).

## Overview

A. Registration by annotating salient landmarks|B. Registration by selecting explicit transformation parameters
--|--
<img src=""imgs/napari_registration_demo2_3.gif"" width=""100%"" />|<img src=""imgs/napari_registration_demo_3.gif"" width=""94%"" />

While working with large and dense 3D and 3D+time gastruloid datasets, we found that being able to visualise and interact with the data dynamically greatly helped processing it.
During the pre-processing stage, dynamical exploration and interaction led to faster tuning of the parameters by allowing direct visual feedback, and gave key biophysical insight during the analysis stage. 

When using our automatic registration tool to spatially register two views of the same organoid, we were sometimes faced with the issue that the tool would not converge to the true registration transformation. This happens when the initial position and orientation of the floating view are too far from their target values. We thus designed a Napari plugin to quickly find a transformation that can be used to initialize our registration tool close to the optimal transformation. From two images loaded in Napari representing two views of the same organoid, the plugin allows the user to 

1. **annotate matching salient landmarks** (e.g bright dead cells or lumen-like structures) in both the reference and floating views, from which an optimal rigid transformation can be found automatically using principal component analysis.



2. **manually define a rigid transformation** by continually varying 3D rotations and translations while observing the results until a satisfying fit is found

<img src=""imgs/Fig_Napari_registration.png"">

## Installation

The plugin obviously requires [napari] to run. If you don't have it yet, follow the instructions [here](https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/fundamentals/installation.html).

The simplest way to install `napari-manual-registration` is via the [napari] plugin manager. Open Napari, go to `Plugins > Install/Uninstall Packages...` and search for `napari-manual-registration`. Click on the install button and you are ready to go!

You can also install `napari-manual-registration` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-manual-registration

To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/jules-vanaret/napari-manual-registration.git

## Usage

The plugin provides two methods to register two views of the same object. The first method consists in manually drawing landmarks in both views, from which the optimal transformation is found automatically using principal component analysis. The second one consists in selecting manually each transformation parameter (rotation and translation) while observing the result in real-time, either in 2D or 3D (the user can switch between 2D and 3D at any time).

> [!CAUTION]
> Be aware that the visualization does not accomodate for voxel anisotropy, so we recommend using isotropic data, or to resize you anisotropic data to an isotropic voxel size (e.g by using [napari-tapenade-processing](https://github.com/GuignardLab/napari-tapenade-processing)).

### A. Registration by annotating salient landmarks

<img src=""imgs/reg_2_3.png"">

Steps:
1. First, load your images in Napari. You can drag and drop them from your file explorer to the Napari viewer, or open them using the `File > Open files...` menu.
2. Click on the `Plugins > Manual Registration` menu to open the plugin.
3. Select the reference layer from the combo box. The reference layer is chosen to be the one that does not move.
4. Select the floating layer from the combo box. The floating layer is the one that will be transformed.
5. Click the `Create landmarks layers` button to create two new Labels layers that will be used to annotate the landmarks in the reference and floating views.
6. We recommend pressing the `Format layers for landmarks matching` button so that your layers are automatically formatted for you to begin the registration process. Napari offers a wide range of customisation options for the layers appearances, so feel free to play with them if our formatting does not fit your preferences. ;)
7. We first recommend hiding the reference layer and the reference landmarks layer by clicking on the eye icon next to the layer name in the layer list. This will allow you to focus on the floating layer and the floating landmarks layer.
8. Click on the `landmarks_floating` layer in the layer list to select it. 
9. Click on the `Activate the paint brush` button in the layer properties widget. This will allow you to draw landmarks in the floating view.
10. Navigate through the z-slices of your images using the slider at the bottom of the plugin window.
11. When you have found a salient landmark in the floating view, start drawing a ""blob"" around it by clicking and dragging your mouse. You can adjust the size of the brush using the `Brush size` slider in the layer properties widget. The shape of the ""blob"" you draw does not matter, as the plugin currently only uses the center of mass of the ""blob"" to locate the landmark.
12. Once you have drawn a landmark, click on the `+` button in the layer properties widget to increase the label value. This will allow you to draw another landmark. Change label value after each landmark you draw. Repeat steps 10 to 12 until you have annotated all the salient landmarks in the floating view.
13. Once you have annotated all the salient landmarks in the floating view, hide the floating layers, and show the reference layers and the reference landmarks layer by clicking on the eye icon next to the layer name in the layer list.
14. Click on the `landmarks_reference` layer in the layer list to select it.
15. Navigate to the z-slice of the reference view that corresponds to the z-slice of the floating view where you drew the first landmark.
16. Draw a ""blob"" around the corresponding landmark in the reference view by clicking and dragging your mouse.
17. Increment your label value by clicking on the `+` button in the layer properties widget each time you draw a new widget. Repeat steps 15 to 17 until you have annotated all the salient landmarks in the reference view.
18. Once you have annotated all the salient landmarks in the reference view, click on the `Run landmark registration` button. The plugin will automatically find the optimal transformation that aligns the floating landmarks to the reference landmarks using principal component analysis. 
19. If you are satisfied with the registration, choose a directory to save the transformation parameters by clicking on the `Choose directory` button. The transformation parameters will be saved in a `.json` file in this directory. Finally, click on the `Save to JSON` button to save the transformation parameters.

### B. Registration by selecting explicit transformation parameters


#### Registration with 3D view

We describe below the steps to register two views of the same object in a purely 3D manner. Note that the plugin also allows to switch between 2D and 3D at any time, and 2D view is described in the next section. 

<img src=""imgs/reg_0.png"">

Steps:
1. First, load your images in Napari. You can drag and drop them from your file explorer to the Napari viewer, or open them using the `File > Open files...` menu.
2. Click on the `Plugins > Manual Registration` menu to open the plugin.
3. Select the reference layer from the combo box. The reference layer is chosen to be the one that does not move.
4. Select the floating layer from the combo box. The floating layer is the one that will be transformed.
5. We recommend pressing the `Format layers for explicit registration` button so that your layers are automatically formatted for you to begin the registration process. Napari offers a wide range of customisation options for the layers appearances, so feel free to play with them if our formatting does not fit your preferences. ;)
6. You can now start the registration process by moving the `Translations` and `Rotations` sliders. The floating layer will be transformed in real-time according to the selected parameters. 
7. To optimize the visibility of your images, you can change the contrast limits and opacity of a layer by clicking on the layer name in the layer list and adjusting the sliders in the layer properties widget.
8. If you wish to hide a layer, you can click on the eye icon next to the layer name in the layer list.
9. Once you are satisfied with the registration, choose a directory to save the transformation parameters by clicking on the `Choose directory` button. The transformation parameters will be saved in a `.json` file in this directory.
10. Finally, click on the `Save to JSON` button to save the transformation parameters.

#### Registration with 2D view

<img src=""imgs/reg_1.png"">

Steps (the steps 1 to 5 are the same as for the 3D registration):
6. If you want to switch to the 2D view, click on the `Toggle 2D/3D view` button (it resembles a square when in 2D mode, or a cube when in 3D mode).
7. Again, feel free to play with the contrast limits and opacity of the layers to optimize the visibility of your images. First click on the layer name in the layer list, then adjust the sliders in the layer properties widget.
8. If you wish to hide a layer, you can click on the eye icon next to the layer name in the layer list.
9. In 2D mode, a slider appears at the bottom of the plugin window. You can use it to slide through the z-slices of your images.
10. You can now start the registration process by moving the `Translations` and `Rotations` sliders. The floating layer will be transformed in real-time according to the selected parameters.
11. Once you are satisfied with the registration, choose a directory to save the transformation parameters by clicking on the `Choose directory` button. The transformation parameters will be saved in a `.json` file in this directory. Finally, click on the `Save to JSON` button to save the transformation parameters.

## Demo dataset

A demo dataset is available [here](https://amubox.univ-amu.fr/s/HLktPNLGgMF4jHT).

### Content

This test dataset is composed of two 3D images `bottom_small.tif` and `top_small.tif` that correspond to two halves of the same sample.

### How to use

 - Load the images from the folder (either drag and drop, or ""File>Open file(s)"").
 - Specify one of the images as the ""Reference layer"" (which is fixed), and the other one as the ""Layer to move"" (usually called ""floating"").
 - Choose between the ""Explicit transforms"" or ""Landmarks matching"" modes, and follow instructions on the plugin repository for further use.

Load in SMLM data and annotate within napari

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/stable/plugins/index.html
-->

## Installation

You can install `napari-locpix` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-locpix


To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/oubino/napari-locpix.git


## Usage

This plugin allows a user to

1. Read in SMLM data
2. Visualise SMLM data in a histogram
3. Add segmentations to the data
4. Extract the underlying localisations from the segmentations

### IO

The input data can be in the form of a .csv or .parquet.

We expect there to be 4 columns at least, which should he identified inthe file column selection:

* X coordinate
* Y coordinate
* Frame
* Channel

If the data has been annotated with this software we can also load this in.
Note however we currently only support loading in annotated data saved as a .parquet folder.
Therefore, we recommend always keeping a .parquet copy until loading in an annotated .csv
is supported.

The data can be outputted to a .parquet or a .csv

Drop localisations with zero label, gives you the option to only save the localisations which have been annotated i.e. labels 1 and above.

Channels labels allows you to give a real name label to each of the channels e.g. Chan 0 label: 'Alexa 647'

### Visualisation

Using the render button you can render the loaded in data according to the histogram settings

X/Y bins defines the number of bins for the histogram

Vis interpolation defines how to interpolate the image before viewing

### Annotations

Annotations can be added using Napari's viewer.

Simply click the add Labels.

Note that this software will expect the labels to be called ""Labels""

Executable script generation for napari plugins.

![](https://github.com/hanjinliu/napari-macrokit/blob/main/images/example.gif)
&uarr; [Example](https://github.com/hanjinliu/napari-macrokit/blob/main/examples/regionprops.py) showing the real-time recording of GUI operation.

This napari plugin aims at making image analysis reproducible with arbitrary input/output types.

## Usage

Create a macro object, decorate functions with `record` method and run!

```python
from napari_macrokit import get_macro

macro = get_macro(""my-plugin-specifier"")  # get macro object

# define a function
@macro.record
def add(a: float, b: float) -> float:
    return a + b

# run
result = add(3.2, 5.4)
add(result, 1.0)

macro

# Out:
# >>> float0 = add(3.2, 5.4)
# >>> float1 = add(float0, 1.0)
```

## Record GUI Operations

You can use recordable functions in your widgets to keep tracks of GUI operations.
More simply, you can double-decorate functions with `record` and `magicgui`.

```python
import numpy as np
from magicgui import magicgui
import napari
from napari.types import ImageData
from napari_macrokit import get_macro

macro = get_macro(""my-plugin-specifier"")  # get macro object

# define recordable magicgui
@magicgui
@macro.record
def add(image: ImageData, b: float) -> ImageData:
    return image + b

viewer = napari.Viewer()  # launch a viewer
viewer.add_image(np.random.random((100, 100)))  # image data
viewer.window.add_dock_widget(add)  # add magicgui to the viewer
```

Running add twice in GUI and you'll find macro updated like below.

```python
macro
# Out
# >>> image0 = add(viewer.layers['Image'].data, 0.06)
# >>> image1 = add(image0, 0.12)
```

## Combining Plugins

Suppose you have two modules that use `napari-macrokit`.

```python
# napari_module_0.py

from napari.types import ImageData
from scipy import ndimage as ndi
from napari_macrokit import get_macro

macro = get_macro(""napari-module-0"")

@macro.record
def gaussian_filter(image: ImageData, sigma: float) -> ImageData:
    return ndi.gaussian_filter(image, sigma=sigma)

@macro.record
def threshold(image: ImageData, value: float) -> ImageData:
    return image > value
```

```python
# napari_module_1.py

from napari.types import ImageData
import numpy as np
from napari_macrokit import get_macro
macro = get_macro(""napari-module-1"")

@macro.record
def estimate_background(image: ImageData) -> float:
    return np.percentile(image, 10.0)

```

You can use functions from both modules to build an analysis workflow by collecting existing macro objects with `collect_macro` function. All the recordable actions in the modules will also be recorded to the returned macro object.

```python
import numpy as np
from napari_macrokit import collect_macro
from napari_module_0 import gaussian_filter, threshold
from napari_module_1 import estimate_background

# global_macro will record all the macro available at this point
global_macro = collect_macro()

# start image analysis!
image = np.random.random((100, 100))

out = gaussian_filter(image, 2.0)
thresh = estimate_background(out)
binary = threshold(out, thresh)

macro
# Out
# >>> image0 = gaussian_filter(arr0, 2.0)
# >>> float0 = estimate_background(image0)
# >>> image1 = threshold(image1, float0)
```

Interface to manually edit layer affine transforms.

- express rotations as quaternion, euler angle, or axis + angle.
- allows rotation around arbitrary origin
- currently, focusing on rigid rotations
- Alt-Drag to rotate a layer independently of the rest.
- image resampling (i.e. ""apply"" the transformation to create new dataset that can be saved)

![Plugin Preview](/preview.jpeg)

caveats:

- only works on 3D Image layers for now, open a feature request for other dims/layers.
- will likely result in ""Non-orthogonal slicing is being requested"" warnings in 2D view.

## Try it out

```python

import napari

v = napari.Viewer()
v.dims.ndisplay = 3
v.open_sample('napari', 'cells3d')
v.window.add_plugin_dock_widget('napari-manual-transforms')

napari.run()

```

This package provides a GUI interfrace for simple mathematical operations on image, point and surface layers.

- addition
- subtraction
- multiplication
- division
- logical and, or, xor
- z-projection (mean and sum)

Operations can be peformed on a single layer or between Image layers (functionaly pending for Surface and Point layers), 
for example adding one layer to another.

When performing operations on two images of different sizes, the result will be the size of the smallest
of the two images.

A plugin to create Matplotlib plots from napari layers

----------------------------------

## Introduction
`napari-matplotlib` is a bridge between `napari` and `matplotlib`, making it easy to create publication quality `Matplotlib` plots based on the data loaded in `napari` layers.

Documentation can be found at https://napari-matplotlib.github.io/

When installed and enabled in the options, it adds an option that when enabled
will make napari load tiffs via memory mapping instead of fully into RAM.

That is, `.tif` and `.tiff` files will be loaded into memory using memory
mapping, which loads the data directly from disk instead of loading the file
at once into RAM. This is beneficial for large files that may not fit into
available RAM.

## What is the purpose of this tool?

McLabel is a semi-automatic local thresholding tool that can help to label cellular objects such as macrophages in fluorescence microscopy images. In cases where a global threshold does not yield satisfactory results, a local threshold based on a ROI drawn by the user may give better results. See the video for an example:
![Mclabel](./img/Mclabel.gif)



## Installation

The plugin can be installed using pip:
```bash
pip install napari-mclabel
```

After succesfull installation the plugin will appear in the plugins menu of napari.

## Usage

![gui](./img/gui.png)

The GUI of McLabel lives in the right pane of napari. If multiple layers are loaded, select the layer that you want to segment. The theshold finding algorithm is by default is triangle, however there are plenty of alternatives and depending on the data another algorithm might be better suited. 

1. Press ""Draw Label""
2. Draw a rough outline around the object of interest. 
3. Press ""Compute Label""
4. If not satisfied with result, adjust threshold using the slider
5. Continue with next object

abstract=""In this work, we present a semi-automatic labelling tool for the annotation of complex cellular structures such as macrophages in fluorescence microscopy images. We present McLabel, a napari plugin that allows users to label structures of interest by simply scribbling outlines around the area of interest, using the triangle thresholding method with post-processing to identify the desired structure. Additionally, manual adaption of the threshold allows for quick and fine-grained local correction of the segmentation. The tool is evaluated in a user study with five experts, who annotated images both with and without the tool. The results show that variability in annotations between experts is reduced when the labelling tool is used and annotation time is reduced by a factor of five on average."",

## Features

This plugin loads image variables stored in `MATLAB` `.mat` files into [napari](https://github.com/napari/napari).

It loads any variable that looks like an image.
Presently, that includes any array with more than two dimensions with size greater than 20 pixels (determined by `shape_is_image()`).

If loading a variable with 3 or more dimensions, the plugin assumes that it is a stack of images, and the dimension with greatest size is the axis of the stack.

### Loading Large Files

If loading a large `.mat` file saved in `HDF5`/`v7.3` format, chunks of the images are loaded as needed, resulting in fast initial load, but potentially slower scrolling.

Slices of the image stacks are randomly sampled to determine min/max contrast values.

## Requirements

This plugin relies on `scipy` to load small `.mat` files and `h5py` (with `dask`) to load larger `HDF5`/`v7.3` `.mat` files.

It implicitly requires `napari` for use.

## Installation

`napari-mat-images` requires [napari](https://github.com/napari/napari) to be installed, although it is not listed as a requirement for installation.
This plugin relies on plugin functionality found in `napari` version \> `0.2.12`. This can be installed via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project):

    $ pip install napari>0.2.12

You can install `napari-mat-images` via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project):

    $ pip install napari-mat-images

## Usage

Once installed, the plugin will be used whenever trying to load a `.mat` file.
This can be done from the `napari` GUI or commandline:

    $ napari my_file.mat

----------------------------------

## Installation

You can install `napari-melt-pool-tracker` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-melt-pool-tracker

# Getting Started with napari-melt-pool-tracker

## Reading Data

- The `napari-melt-pool-tracker` plugin can read h5 files from the ID19 and TOMCAT beam lines.
- When opening an h5 file in napari, select the ""Melt Pool Tracker"" as the reader for the mentioned beamlines.
- Once the data is loaded, you have the option to save the layer as a tif file if needed.

## Pre-processing

- For large images, it is recommended to crop them in both time and space to include only the relevant parts of the image stack.

## 1. Determine Laser Speed and Position

- This step helps identify the laser in the images for later reslicing the stack with a moving window following the laser.
- It generates a projection of the stack along the y-axis, creating an x-t image where the laser's position appears as an oblique line in the projection.

**To perform this step:**

1. Select the stack you want to work on using the ""Input"" drop-down menu.
2. Choose one of three projection modes:
   - Default: Maximum projection along y.
   - Pre mean: Divide each frame by the mean projection along the t-axis (to remove background) and then perform a maximum projection along y.
   - Post median: Perform a maximum projection along y and then divide the projected images by a median-filtered version in the x-direction (to remove horizontal strips).
3. Click ""Run"" to generate a new layer with the projected image and a shapes layer with a line.
4. Select the line layer, use the ""Select vertices"" tool to match the line with the laser in the projected image.

## 2. Reslice with Moving Window

- This step reslices the stack with a moving window that follows the laser's position.

**To perform this step:**

1. Select the input stack using the ""Stack"" drop-down menu.
2. Choose the line layer with the laser's position using the ""Line"" drop-down menu.
3. Adjust the ""Left margin"" and ""Right margin"" sliders to set the size of the window to the left and right of the laser's position.
4. Click ""Run"" to create three new layers: a resliced stack, a shapes layer indicating the laser's position based on your previous annotation, and a shapes layer with lines indicating the window's position in the original image.
5. If the window size doesn't fit the melt pool correctly, adjust it using the margin sliders. Disable the ""Auto run"" checkbox for large stacks to control when reslicing occurs.

## 3. Filter Image

- This step aims to reduce noise in the images by applying a median filter.

**To filter the image:**

- Select the resliced layer as the input.
- Use the ""Kernel"" sliders to set the size of the median filter along different axes.
- Disable ""Auto run"" for large stacks due to the computational cost. After median filtering, the function applies Otsu thresholding to remove the background. Adjust the contrast as needed.

## 4. Calculate Radial Gradient

- This step calculates the gray value gradient in the radial direction with respect to a point on the surface, forming the origin. You can set the horizontal position of the origin using the position slider.

**To calculate the radial gradient:**

- Select the resliced and filtered stack as input.
- Adjust the contrast for the new radial gradient layer.

## 5. Annotate

- Annotation of points is done using the [napari-cursor-tracker](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-cursor-tracker) plugin.

**To annotate points:**

- Select any of the resliced layers as your reference image.
- Change the name in the ""Name of the tracked point"" text box to define the point you want to track, e.g., 'MP depth'.
- Click ""Add new layer"" to create a new points layer with the specified name, automatically selected as the active layer.
- Start tracking by pressing 't' on your keyboard. Enable ""Auto play when tracking is started"" for automatic playback.
- Adjust playback parameters as needed. Setting ""Loop mode"" to 'once' is advised to prevent overwriting tracked points. You can track points manually by scrolling through slices/frames (hold down `ctrl`) and saving your cursor positions at each index change.

## Saving and Processing Results

- You can save the 'window_coordinates' layer and point layers with tracked points as CSV files for further processing with external software.

abstract = {Abstract Bacteria often grow into matrix-encased three-dimensional (3D) biofilm communities, which can be imaged at cellular resolution using confocal microscopy. From these 3D images, measurements of single-cell properties with high spatiotemporal resolution are required to investigate cellular heterogeneity and dynamical processes inside biofilms. However, the required measurements rely on the automated segmentation of bacterial cells in 3D images, which is a technical challenge. To improve the accuracy of single-cell segmentation in 3D biofilms, we first evaluated recent classical and deep learning segmentation algorithms. We then extended StarDist, a state-of-the-art deep learning algorithm, by optimizing the post-processing for bacteria, which resulted in the most accurate segmentation results for biofilms among all investigated algorithms. To generate the large 3D training dataset required for deep learning, we developed an iterative process of automated segmentation followed by semi-manual correction, resulting in >18,000 annotated Vibrio cholerae cells in 3D images. We demonstrate that this large training dataset and the neural network with optimized post-processing yield accurate segmentation results for biofilms of different species and on biofilm images from different microscopes. Finally, we used the accurate single-cell segmentation results to track cell lineages in biofilms and to perform spatiotemporal measurements of single-cell growth rates during biofilm development.}

## Installation

You can install `napari-meshio` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-meshio



To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/GenevieveBuckley/napari-meshio.git


## How to use napari-meshio

### Read surface data from file

Drag and drop the file onto the napari viewer.

*Note: [Here](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/ply/ply.html) are a number of `.ply` example files you can download to try, like [this airplane](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/ply/airplane.ply) (see [image](https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/ply/airplane.png)).*

### Open example surface data

Launch the napari viewer, then open one of the sample datasets (eg: the [Stanford bunny](http://graphics.stanford.edu/data/3Dscanrep/)) from the file menu:

`File` > `Open Sample` > `napari-meshio` > `bunny`

Or, open sample data from python with:

```python
import napari

viewer = napari.Viewer(ndisplay=3)
viewer.open_sample('napari-meshio', 'bunny')
```

### Save surface data

To save a surface layer, click the layer name to select it, and then choose save from the file menu:

`File` > `Save selected layer(s)`

You can also use keyboard shortcuts to save the selected surface layer:
- Windows/Linux: `Control` + `S`
- Mac: `⌘` + `S`

Or, save surface layers from python with:
```python
filename = ""bunny.stl""
viewer.layers['bunny'].save(filename)
```
*Note: this code example assumes you have the Stanford bunny example dataset loaded.*

A [wide variety of surface mesh file formats are supported](#supported-mesh-file-formats) by
[meshio](https://github.com/nschloe/meshio).
If no file extension is provided when saving a surface layer,
the default is the `.ply` polygon file format.

### Supported mesh file formats

*Note: Only triangular mesh faces are supported by napari.*

The [meshio](https://github.com/nschloe/meshio) library documentation describes the supported file formats:

> There are various mesh formats available for representing unstructured meshes.
meshio can read and write all of the following and smoothly converts between them:

## Installation

We describe installation with mamba, a faster version of conda which we recommend. Installation with conda is the exact same, except replace `mamba` with `conda` Run the following command:

```
mamba create -n napari-mm3 -c conda-forge conda-build tensorflow napari
``` 
Now, you need to install our code (please let us know if this causes problems -- it has been a pain point in the past). To do so, clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/junlabucsd/napari-mm3.git
```

Then, run the following commands from within your conda environment:
```
cd napari-mm3
pip install -e .
```
This supplies you with the latest, most recent version of our code.

If you would like to have a more stable version, simply run `pip install napari-mm3`. In general, we recommend going off of the github version.

napari-MM3 can use the [python-bioformats](https://pypi.org/project/python-bioformats/) library to import various image file formats. It can be installed with pip:
```
pip install python-bioformats
```
If your raw images are in the .nd2 format, they will be read in with the nd2reader package. In this case, Bio-Formats is not required.

NOTES:
Not running the conda command above and trying to install things in a different way may lead to difficult issues with PyQt5. We recommend following the above commands to simplify the situation.
Using `pip -e .` instead of `mamba develop .` is a deliberate choice, the former did not seem to register the plugin with napari.

* [PickChannels](https://github.com/junlabucsd/napari-mm3/blob/main/docs/pickchannels-widget.md) -- User guided selection of empty and full traps.

### b. Segmentation

___With Otsu's method:___

* [Subtract](https://github.com/junlabucsd/napari-mm3/blob/main/docs/subtract-widget.md) -- Remove (via subtraction) empty traps from the background of traps that contain cells; run this on the phase contrast channel.

* [SegmentOtsu](https://github.com/junlabucsd/napari-mm3/blob/main/docs/segmentotsu-widget.md) -- Use Otsu's method to segment cells.

___With U-Net:___

* [Annotate](https://github.com/junlabucsd/napari-mm3/blob/main/docs/annotate-widget.md) -- annotate images for ML (U-Net or similar) training purposes.

* [Train U-Net](https://github.com/junlabucsd/napari-mm3/blob/main/docs/trainunet-widget.md) -- Train a U-Net model for cell segmentation.

* [SegmentUnet](https://github.com/junlabucsd/napari-mm3/blob/main/docs/segmentunet-widget.md) -- Run U-Net segmentation.

### c. Tracking

### d. Fluorescence data analysis

* [Subtract](https://github.com/junlabucsd/napari-mm3/blob/main/docs/subtract-widget.md) -- Remove (via subtraction) empty traps from the background of traps that contain cells. This time, run this on your fluorescence channels.

* [Colors](https://github.com/junlabucsd/napari-mm3/blob/main/docs/colors-widget.md) -- Calculate fluorescence information.

### e. Focus tracking

* [Foci](https://github.com/junlabucsd/napari-mm3/blob/main/docs/foci-widget.md) -- We use this to track `foci` (bright fluorescent spots) inside of cells.

### f. Extracting data and plotting

* The notebook [here](https://github.com/junlabucsd/napari-mm3/blob/main/notebooks/napari_mm3_analysis_template.ipynb) demonstrates how to extract, filter and visualize the lineage data output by the [Track](https://github.com/junlabucsd/napari-mm3/blob/main/docs/track-widget.md) widget.


### g. Outputs, inputs, and file structure
Finally, to better understand the data formats, you may wish to refer to the following documents:

* [Input image guidelines](https://github.com/junlabucsd/napari-mm3/blob/main/docs/Input-images-guidelines.md)

* [File structure](https://github.com/junlabucsd/napari-mm3/blob/main/docs/file-structure.md)

To test
-------

I haven't had access to real hardware yet, so this has all been
developed with simulated devices.

1. Start the device server with simulated devices.

    a. Create a device server configuration file like so::

        import microscope
        from microscope.device_server import device
        from microscope.simulators import (
            SimulatedCamera,
            SimulatedFilterWheel,
            SimulatedLightSource,
            SimulatedStage,
        )

        DEVICES = [
            device(SimulatedCamera, ""localhost"", 8000,),
            device(SimulatedLightSource, ""localhost"", 8001),
            device(SimulatedFilterWheel, ""localhost"", 8002,
                   {""positions"": 6}),
            device(SimulatedStage, ""localhost"", 8003,
                   {""limits"": {""X"": microscope.AxisLimits(0, 25000),
                               ""Y"": microscope.AxisLimits(0, 12000)}}),
        ]

    b. Start the device server (ensure port 8000-8003 are unused)::

        $ device-server path-to-microscope-config.py

2. Start napari

3. Plugins > Add Dock Widget > microscope: MicroscopeWidget

4. Connect to the camera:

    a. On the new widget, click on the ""Add device"" button.

    b. Enter the camera URI `PYRO:SimulatedCamera@localhost:8000`

5. Tick the `Enabled` box to enable the camera and then press the
""Snap"" button.

6. A random values image will appear displayed on the napari viewer.
Keep pressing the ""Snap"" button to get new images.  The top left
corner of the image is the simulated image number.

7. Connect to the other simulated devices.  Their URIs are:

    a. PYRO:SimulatedLightSource@localhost:8001
    b. PYRO:SimulatedFilterWheel@localhost:8002
    c. PYRO:SimulatedStage@localhost:8003

8. Changing the other simulated devices, doesn't really do much (but
does change state of the devices, as can be seen in the logs)


Test with stage aware camera
----------------------------

This is pretty much the same as before but one can use a large RGB
TIFF (histology samples are perfect) to simulate a camera that returns
subsections of the image file based on the simulated stage position.

For quick example, try::

    wget https://zenodo.org/record/1445489/files/B0002.tif

And use the following device server configuration file::

    from microscope.device_server import device
    from microscope.simulators.stage_aware_camera import simulated_setup_from_image

    DEVICES = [
        device(simulated_setup_from_image, ""localhost"", 8000,
               conf={""filepath"": ""B0002.tif""}),
    ]

The URI for the devices will be::

    PYRO:camera@localhost:8000
    PYRO:filterwheel@localhost:8000
    PYRO:stage@localhost:8000

Changing the filterwheel changes which channel from the image is
returned.  Changing the stage coordinates changes the image that is
returned (but beware of the corners, pixels outside the image size are

This napari plugin is an adaptation of [metroid](https://github.com/zoccoler/metroid). It creates several regions of interest of similar area over cells in a fluorescence video (2D+time). It then gets ROIs means over time and performs signal denoising: fixes photobleaching and separates signal from noise by means of blind source separation (with or without wavelet filtering).

## Quick Walkthrough

Below is a full demonstration of using napari-metroid. It shows the following:
  * Open sample data;
  * Create cell mask;
  * Split mask into ROIs of similar area;
  * Get ROIs signals over time and plots two of them;
  * Remove photobleaching;
  * Remove noise:
    * Use ICA to decompose ROIs signals into independent components;
    * Plot 4 components;
    * Manually select the component of interest (source);
    * Perform inverse transformation with selected source;

## Installation

Download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) or [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#).

Create a new conda environment:

    conda create -n metroid-env python=3.8

Install napari, e.g. via pip:

    pip install ""napari[all]""

Install `napari-metroid` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-metroid

To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/zoccoler/napari-metroid.git

## Usage
### Open Sample Data

This plugin comes with two sample videos:
- Cell1 Video Action Potential: 2D + time fluorescence video of a rat isolated cardiomyocyte labeled with a membrane potential dye upon which an external electrical field pulse is applied.
- Cell1 Video Electroporation: Same cell, but submitted to a strong external electrical field pulse.

You can open them under ""File -> Open Sample -> napari-metroid"", as shown below. Both videos are loaded from the [metroid main repository](https://github.com/zoccoler/metroid). To know more about the experimental conditions, please refer to the [original publication](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-020-03661-9).

![](https://github.com/zoccoler/napari-metroid/raw/main/figures/load_sample_data.gif)

### Open Plugin Main Interface

![](https://github.com/zoccoler/napari-metroid/raw/main/figures/open_plugin.gif)

### Auto-generate Cell Mask

Metroid can generate cell binary masks automatically by cumulative sum of images until any pixel saturation happens. It then applies Otsu thresholding and removes small objects.

![](https://github.com/zoccoler/napari-metroid/raw/main/figures/auto_create_mask.png)

### Split Mask into ROIs

By default, a cell mask is split into 32 regions of interest (ROIs) in a double-layer fashion: An outer layer of ROIs and an inner layer. 
The method is solely based on the shape of the cell mask and the main criteria is that ROIs must have similar areas. The number of ROIs in each layer can be editted. 

![](https://github.com/zoccoler/napari-metroid/raw/main/figures/mess.png)

### Get ROI Means over Time

The 'Get Signals' button serves to collect each ROI mean fluorescence over time and enable plotting. There, you can optionally provide the frame rate so that the time axis is properly displayed.
Double click over a ROI to have its signal plotted. Hold the 'ALT' key to plot multiple signals together.

![](https://github.com/zoccoler/napari-metroid/raw/main/figures/get_signals.gif)

### Remove Photobleaching

Metroid removes photobleaching by curve fitting over time periods that lack the cellular signal (which can be an action potential or an electroporation signal). That is why the 'Transitory' parameter is important. Action potentials are transitory signals whereas electroporation (at least for the duration of this experiment) are not, and the algorithm must be informed about that for proper trend removal.

![](https://github.com/zoccoler/napari-metroid/raw/main/figures/remov_photob.gif)

### Filter Signals

Cellular signals are filtered by separating signal components with either PCA or ICA (plus optional wavelet filtering). It then chooses one (or several) components and it applies the inverse transform using only the selected components. Metroid can do this component/source selection automatically based on estimations of signal power. Instead, we show below the manual selection procedure, where 4 components are plotted and the user selects one of them.

![](https://github.com/zoccoler/napari-metroid/raw/main/figures/bssd.gif)

### Save Outputs

Raw, corrected and filtered signals, as well as time and components, are arranged in a table with values for each time point. The table is displayed as a widget after each Run button click. Estimated signal-to-noise (SNR) in dB for each label/ROI are also provided (in this case, each line corresponds to a ROI, not a time point).
The user can save these data by clicking on the buttons ""Copy to clipboard"" or ""Save as csv..."".

A **Napari** plugin for extracting single molecule sequences from single/multi-channel SMLM microscopy data. 

Compatible with both ALEX and FRET data. All functions are parallelised/GPU accelerated where possible to increase performance.
Multiple datasets can be loaded and processed in parallel.

napari-molseeq uses **Picasso** (picassosr) as a backend and includes features for **aligning** image channels/datasets, **undrifting** images, **detecting/fitting** localisations and extracting **traces**, and supports both **ALEX** and **FRET** data. Traces can be exported in different formats for downstream analysis.

napari-molseeq traces can be analysed with TraceAnalyser: https://github.com/piedrro/TraceAnalyser

This is still undergoing development, so some features may not work as expected.

This was built by Dr Piers Turner from the Kapanidis Lab, University of Oxford.

## Installation

You can install `napari-micromanager` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-micromanager

You will also need a Qt backend such as PySide2/6, or PyQt5/6.  **PyQt is
preferred and receives more testing**. If you've previously installed napari
into this environment with `pip install napari[all]`, then you will likely
already have it. If not, you will also need to install a Qt backend of your
choice:

    pip install pyqt5  # or any of {pyqt5, pyqt6, pyside2, pyside6}

### Getting micromanager adapters

The easiest way to get the micromanager adapters is to use:

```
mmcore install
```

this will install micromanager to the pymmcore_plus folder in your site-package; use this to see where:

```
python -c ""from pymmcore_plus import find_micromanager; print(find_micromanager())""
```

alternatively, you can direct pymmcore_plus to your own micromanager installation with the `MICROMANAGER_PATH`
environment variable:

```
export MICROMANAGER_PATH='/path/to/Micro-Manager-...'
```

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome.

### Launching napari with plugin

You can launch napari and automatically load this plugin using the `launch-dev.py` script:

```bash
python launch-dev.py
```

Alternatively you can run:

```bash
napari -w napari-micromanager
```

A user-friendly SMLM analysis platfrom for napari, which includes single molecule localisation, tracking, and analysis features. 
Based on established python packages such as **Picasso**, **GPUfit** and **Trackpy**.
This plugin was designed to detect/track single molecules inside cells, but can be used for any other SMLM/tracking application.

All functions are parallelised/GPU accelerated where possible to increase performance.
Multiple datasets can be loaded and processed in parallel.

Single molecule localisations can be filtered by their properties (e.g. photons, width, etc.) and can be rendered as a super resolution image.

Napari-moltrack is also compatible with **FRET** and **ALEX FRET** image data, can be used to calculate FRET efficiencies of single molecules/tracks.

Segmentations can be used to exclude regions from single molecule localisation and tracking.
Segmentations can be added automatically using Cellpose or can be added manually. Includes tools for editing/modifying segmentations at a sub-pixel resolution.

Compatible with both single and multi-channel .tif and .fits files.

napari-moltrack was written by Piers Turner, Kapanidis Group, University of Oxford.

A napari plugin that read molecular structure files. It reads PDB and MMCIF files using [`atomium`](https://github.com/samirelanduk/atomium), expanding molecular assemblies to a full visualization. Data is loaded into napari as `Points` for ball representation and `Vectors` for stick representation. If multiple models or assemblies are detected, they will be loaded as separate objects.

napari plugin of [NanoPyx](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/NanoPyx) (the successor to NanoJ) - focused on light microscopy and super-resolution imaging.

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

## What is the NanoPyx 🔬 Library?

NanoPyx is a library specialized in the analysis of light microscopy and super-resolution data.
It is a successor to [NanoJ](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/NanoJ-Core), which is a Java library for the analysis of super-resolution microscopy data.

NanoPyx focuses on performance, by heavily exploiting cython aided multiprocessing and simplicity. It implements methods for the bioimage analysis field, with a special emphasis on those developed by the [Henriques Laboratory](https://henriqueslab.github.io/).
It will be distributed as a Python Library and also as [Codeless Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/NanoPyx#codeless-jupyter-notebooks-available), that can be run locally or on Google Colab, and as a [napari plugin](https://github.com/HenriquesLab/napari-NanoPyx).

You can read more about NanoPyx in our [publication].

Currently it implements the following approaches:
- A reimplementation of the NanoJ image registration, SRRF and Super Resolution metrics
- eSRRF
- Non-local means denoising
- More to come soon™

This napari plugin written [by Loic A. Royer](https://twitter.com/loicaroyer) provides sample datasets from NASA.
In particular, you can access directly from napari the recently released images for the [James Webb Space Telescope](https://webb.nasa.gov/), as well as
some of the classic and most beautiful images obtained by the venerable and still strong [Hubble Space Telescope](https://hubblesite.org/). 
More images will be added over time.

Thanks to (NASA)[https://www.nasa.gov/] for releasing these incredible images!

**A toolbox for annotating objects one by one in nD.**

This plugin contains some tools to make 2D/3D (and technically any dimensional) annotation easier.
Main features:
 * auto-filling labels
 * label slice interpolation (geometric mean, RPSV representation)
 * minimal contour segmentation

If the <code>[napari-bbox]</code> plugin is also installed (see [Installation](#installation)), you can also
 * list objects annotated with bounding boxes 
 * visualize selected objects from different projections

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/plugins/index.html
-->

## Installation

You can install `napari-nD-annotator` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-nD-annotator

The plugin is also available in [napari-hub], to install it directly from napari, please refer to
[plugin installation instructions] at the official [napari] website.


### Optional packages
There are some functionalities which require additional Python packages.

#### Bounding boxes
The bounding box and object list functionality requires the <code>[napari-bbox]</code> Python package.
If you want to use these features, install <code>[napari-bbox]</code> separately either using [pip] or directly from napari.
You can also install it together with this plugin:
```
pip install napari-nD-annotator[bbox]
```

#### Minimal surface
To use the minimal surface method, you will need the <code>[minimal-surface]</code> Python package as well. Please install it using [pip]:

Separately:
```
pip install minimal-surface
```

Or bundled with the plugin:
```
pip install napari-nD-annotator[ms]
```
> [!WARNING]
> The <code>[minimal-surface]</code> package is only available for Windows at the time. We are actively working on bringing it to Linux and Mac systems as well.

#

If you would like to install all optional packages, use
```
pip install napari-nD-annotator[all]
```
###
If any problems occur during installation or while using the plugin, please [file an issue].

## Usage
You can start napari with the plugin's widgets already opened as:

    napari -w napari-nD-annotator ""Object List"" ""Annotation Toolbox""


### Bounding boxes
The main idea is to create bounding boxes around objects we want to annotate, crop them, and annotate them one by one. This has mainly two advantages when visualizing in 3D:

1. We don't have to load the whole data into memory
2. The surrounding objects won't occlude the annotated ones, making it easier to check the annotation.

Bounding boxes can be created from the `Object list` widget. The dimensionality of the bounding box layer will be determined from the image layer. As bounding boxes are created, a small thumbnail will be displayed.

The proposed pipeline goes as follows:

 1. Create a bounding box layer
 2. Select data parts using the bounding boxes
 3. Select an object from the object list
 4. Annotate the object
 5. Repeat from 3.

### Slice interpolation
The `Interpolation` tab contains tools for estimating missing annotation slices from existing ones. There are multiple options:
 * Geometric: the interpolation will be determined by calculating the average of the corresponding contour points.
 * RPSV: A more sophisticated average contour calculation, see the preprint [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.02823.pdf).
 * Distance-based: a signed distance transform is applied to the annotations. The missing slices will be filled in using their 
weighted sum.

> **Note**: Geometric and RPSV interpolation works only when there's a single connected mask on each slice. If you want to 
> interpolate disjoint objects (*e.g.* dividing cells), use distance based interpolation instead.

> **Note**: Distance-based interpolation might give bad results if some masks are too far away from each other on the same slice
> and there's a big offset compared to the other slice used in the interpolation. If you get unsatisfactory results, try
> annotating more slices (skip less frames).

### Minimal contour
This plugin can estimate a minimal contour, which is calculated from a point set on the edges of the object, which are provided by the user. This contour will follow some kind of image feature (pixels with high gradient or high/low intensity).
Features:
 * With a single click a new point can be added to the set. This will also extend the contour with the curve shown in red
 * A double click will close the curve by adding both the red and gray curves to the minimal contour
 * When holding `Shift`, the gray and red highlight will be swapped, so the other curve can be added to the contour
 * With the `Ctrl` button down a straight line can be added instead of the minimal path
 * If the anchor points were misplaced, the last point can be removed by right-clicking, or the whole point set can be cleared by pressing `Esc`
 * The `Param` value at the widget will decide, how strongly should the contour follow edges on the image. Higher value means higher sensitivity to image data, while a lower value will be closer to straight lines.
 * Different features can be used, like image gradient or pixel intensities, and also user-defined features (using Python)
   * the image is accessed as the `image` variable, and the features should be stored in the `features` variable in the small code editor widget

This functionality can be used by selecting the `Minimal Contour` tab in the `Annotation Toolbox` widget, which will create a new layer called `Anchors`.

> **Warning**: Do not remove the `Anchors` layer!

> **Warning**: Some utility layers appear in the layer list when using the plugin. These are marked with a lock (:lock:) symbol.
> __Do not remove them or modify their data, as this will most probably break the plugin!__ However, you can change their appearance,
> *e.g.* their color settings.

* Allows **advanced, arbitrary image processing** workflows to be used by novices.
* **User-friendly** sparse annotation and batch training of **machine learning classifiers**.
* Flexible label measurements, parsing of metadata, and summarization for **easily readable datasets**.
* Designed for ease of use, modification, and reproducibility.

## Installation

**napari-ndev** is a pure Python package, and can be installed with [pip]:

```bash
pip install napari-ndev
```

If napari is currently not installed in your environment, you will also need to include a QtPy backend:

```bash
pip install napari-ndev[qtpy-backend]
```

The easiest way to get started with **napari-ndev** is to install all the optional dependencies (see note below) with:

```bash
pip install napari-ndev[all]
```

----------------------------------

### Optional Libraries

**napari-ndev** is most useful when interacting with some other napari plugins (e.g. napari-assistant) and can read additional filetypes. A few extra BSD3 compatible napari-plugins may be installed with [pip]:

```bash
pip install napari-ndev[extras]
```

**napari-ndev** can optionally use GPL-3 licensed libraries to enhance its functionality, but are not required. If you choose to install and use these optional dependencies, you must comply with the GPL-3 license terms. The main functional improvement is from some `bioio` libraries to support extra image formats, including `czi` and `lif` files. These libraries can be installed with [pip]:

```bash
pip install napari-ndev[gpl-extras]
```

In addition, you may need to install specific [`bioio` readers](https://github.com/bioio-devs/bioio) to support your specific image, such as `bioio-czi` and `bioio-lif` (included in `[gpl-extras]`) or `bioio-bioformats`.

### Development Libraries

For development use the `[dev]` optional libraries to verify your changes, which includes the `[docs]` and `[testing]` optional groups. However, the Github-CI will test pull requests with `[testing]` only.

----------------------------------

The wide breadth of this plugin's scope is only made possible by the amazing libraries and plugins from the python and napari community, especially [Robert Haase](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf).

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome. Tests can be run with [tox], please ensure
the coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request.

napari plugin for nd tiff folders with optional CUDA or OpenCL-based deskewing.

Built-in support for folders of (skewed) lattice light sheet tiffs.

![napari-ndtiffs demo](https://github.com/tlambert03/napari-ndtiffs/raw/main/demo.gif)

----------------------------------

*This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using with [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.*

## Features

- Drag and drop a folder of tiffs onto napari window to view easily 
  - (currently designed to detect  lattice light sheet tiffs, but easily
    adjustable)
- If lattice `Settings.txt` file is found, will deskew automatically (only if
  necessary)
- Lazily loads dataset on demand.  quickly load preview your data.
- Handles `.zip` archives as well!  Just directly compress your tiff folder,
  then drop it into napari.
- All OpenCL deskewing, works on GPU as well as CPU, falls back to scipy if
  [PyOpenCL] is unavailable.
- CuPy-based deskewing will work for cards with NVIDIA GPUs that support CUDA.
  CuPy 8.x releases should work, although CuPy >= 9 is recommended. If [CuPy]
  is unavailable, the [PyOpenCL] implementation is used instead.

It would not be hard to support arbitrary filenaming patterns!  If you have a
folder of tiffs with a consistent naming scheme and would like to take advantage
of this plugin, feel free to open an issue!

## Installation

You can install `napari-ndtiffs` via [pip]:

```shell
pip install napari-ndtiffs
```

To also install PyOpenCL (for faster deskewing):

```shell
pip install napari-ndtiffs[opencl]
```

On NVIDIA GPUs with CUDA support, the [CuPy] implementation may be faster than
[PyOpenCL]. CuPy also has experimental support for AMD GPUs via HIP/ROCm. See
the CuPy [installation instructions](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html)


## Usage

In most cases, just drop your folder onto napari, or use `viewer.open(""path"")`

### Overriding parameters

You can control things like voxel size and deskewing angle as follows:

```python
from napari_ndtiffs import parameter_override
import napari

viewer = napari.Viewer()
with parameter_override(angle=45, name=""my image""):
    viewer.open(""path/to/folder"", plugin=""ndtiffs"")
```

Valid keys for `parameter_override` include:

- **dx**: (`float`) the pixel size, in microns
- **dz**: (`float`)the z step size, in microns
- **deskew**: (`bool`) whether or not to deskew, (by default, will deskew if angle > 0, or if a lattice metadata file is detected that requires deskewing) 
- **angle**: (`float`) the angle of the light sheet relative to the coverslip
- **padval**: (`float`) the value with which to pad the image edges when deskewing (default is 0)
- **contrast_limits**: (`2-tuple of int`) (min, max) contrast_limits to use when viewing the image
- **name**: (`str`) an optional name for the image

### Sample data

Try it out with test data: [download sample data](https://www.dropbox.com/s/up4ywrn2sckjunc/lls_mitosis.zip?dl=1)

You can unzip if you like, or just drag the zip file onto the napari window.

Or, from command line, use:

```bash
napari path/to/lls_mitosis.zip
```

## Debugging

To monitor file io and deskew activity, enter the following in the napari console:

```python
import logging
logging.getLogger('napari_ndtiffs').setLevel('DEBUG')
```

##### Abstract:

Accurate and efficient 3D segmentation is essential for both clinical and research applications.
While foundation models like SAM have revolutionized interactive segmentation, their 2D design and domain shift limitations make them ill-suited for 3D medical images.
Current adaptations address some of these challenges but remain limited, either lacking volumetric awareness, offering restricted interactivity, or supporting only a small set of structures and modalities.
Usability also remains a challenge, as current tools are rarely integrated into established imaging platforms and often rely on cumbersome web-based interfaces with restricted functionality.
We introduce nnInteractive, the first comprehensive 3D interactive open-set segmentation method.
It supports diverse prompts—including points, scribbles, boxes, and a novel lasso prompt—while leveraging intuitive 2D interactions to generate full 3D segmentations.
Trained on 120+ diverse volumetric 3D datasets (CT, MRI, PET, 3D Microscopy, etc.), nnInteractive sets a new state-of-the-art in accuracy, adaptability, and usability.
Crucially, it is the first method integrated into widely used image viewers (e.g., Napari, MITK), ensuring broad accessibility for real-world clinical and research applications.
Extensive benchmarking demonstrates that nnInteractive far surpasses existing methods, setting a new standard for AI-driven interactive 3D segmentation.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

You need a Linux or Windows computer with a Nvidia GPU. 10GB of VRAM is recommended. Small objects should work with \<6GB.

##### 1. Create a virtual environment:

nnInteractive supports Python 3.10+ and works with Conda, pip, or any other virtual environment. Here’s an example using Conda:

```
conda create -n nnInteractive python=3.12
conda activate nnInteractive
```

##### 2. Install the correct PyTorch for your system

Go to the [PyTorch homepage](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) and pick the right configuration.
Note that since recently PyTorch needs to be installed via pip. This is fine to do within your conda environment.

For Ubuntu with a Nvidia GPU, pick 'stable', 'Linux', 'Pip', 'Python', 'CUDA12.6' (if all drivers are up to date, otherwise use and older version):

```
pip3 install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu126
```

##### 3. Install this repository + dependencies via

Install napari if necessary

```bash
pip install napari[all]
```

Install the plugin via pip:

```bash
pip install napari-nninteractive
```

Or clone and install this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/napari-nninteractive
cd napari-nninteractive
pip install -e .
```

**Note:** Model weights are automatically downloaded on first use. This can take up to a couple of minutes depending on your internet connection

## Getting Started

Use one of these three options to start napari and activate the plugin.
Afterward, Drag and drop your images into napari.

\***Note if getting asked which plugin to use for opening .nii.gz files use napari-nifti.**

a) Start napari, then Plugins -> nnInteractive.

```
napari
```

b) Run this to start napari with the plugin already started.

```
napari -w napari-nninteractive
```

c) Run this to start napari with the plugin and open an image directly

```
napari demo_data/liver_145_0000.nii.gz -w napari-nninteractive
```

# How to use

**Note:** To open Nifti (.nii.gz, .nii) files we recommend to select napari-nifti.

GUI for the nucleaAIzer method in Napari.

![Plugin interface in napari.](https://github.com/etasnadi/napari_nucleaizer/blob/main/napari_screenshot.png?raw=true)

## Overview

This is a napari plugin to execute the nucleaizer nuclei segmentation algorithm.

### Main functionalities

Using this plugin will be able to

1. Load your image into Napar, then outline the nuclei.
2. Specify an image folder containing lots of images and an output folder, and automatically segment all of the images in the input folder.
3. If you are not satisfied with the results, you can train your own model:
    1. You can use our pretrained models and fine tune them on your data.
    2. You can skip the nucleaizer pipeline and train only on your data.


### Supported image types

We have several pretrained models for the following image modelities:
* fluorescent microscopy images
* IHC stained images
* brightfield microscopy images,

among others. For the detailed descriptions of our models, see: https://zenodo.org/record/6800341.

### How it works?

For the description of the algorithm, see our paper: ""Hollandi et al.: nucleAIzer: A Parameter-free Deep Learning Framework for Nucleus Segmentation Using Image Style Transfer, Cell Systems, 2020. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2020.04.003""

The original code (https://github.com/spreka/biomagdsb) is partially transformed into a python package (nucleaizer_backend) to actually perform the operations. See the project page of the backend at: https://github.com/etasnadi/nucleaizer_backend.

If you wish to use the web interface, check: http://nucleaizer.org.

-->

## Install

1. Create an environment (recommended).

2. Install napari: `pip install ""napari[pyqt5]""`. Other methods: https://napari.org/tutorials/fundamentals/installation.html

3. Install the plugin into napari:

    * User mode from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/napari-nucleaizer/): start Napari (command line: `napari`) and select he **Install/Uninstall Plugins...** under the **Plugins** menu. In the popup, filter for `napari-nucleaizer`.

    * Developer mode: clone this project and use `pythhon3 -m pip install -e <path>` to install the project locally **into the same evnrionment as napari**. It has the advantage that you will have the latest version.
## Run

1. Start Napari by calling `napari` from the command line.
2. Then, activate the plugin in the `Plugins` menu. If you successfully installed the plugin, you have to see something like this:

A Napari plugin for automated cell nuclei detection, proliferation and population growth analysis, and single-cell tracking in brightfield and fluorescent nuclei timelapse microscopy images.

napari-nuclephaser is an open-source Napari plugin designed for scientists who need to measure cell proliferation rates, analyze population growth, and perform individual cell tracking on timelapse microscopy images. It utilizes [Ultralytics](https://docs.ultralytics.com/) YOLO object detection models and [obss/sahi](https://github.com/obss/sahi) sliced inference methods to detect cell nuclei on brightfield and fluorescent images of any size, including large whole slide ones. Learn more with [documentation](https://napari-nuclephaser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) and [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.13.653705v1).

## Nuclei detection

We trained a series of [YOLOv5](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) and [YOLOv11](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) models to detect nuclei on phase contrast images. It can be used for counting cells or for individual cell tracking (using nuclei detections as tracking markers). Prominent features of this approach are:
- Napari-nuclephaser plugin includes [obss/sahi](https://github.com/obss/sahi) functionality, allowing detection on images of arbitrary sizes.

- YOLO models are fast, providing reasonable inference speed even with CPU.
- Ability to predict and automatically count nuclei on stacks of images, making it convenient for cell population growth studies and individual cell tracking.

- Calibration algorithm that allows measuring accuracy for each specific use case.

## Calibration algorithm

Result of object detection model inference is highly dependent on _confidence threshold_ parameter.

<p align=""center"">
  <picture>
  <source media=""(prefers-color-scheme: dark)"" srcset=https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8a13085f-c7ea-45f0-8931-6851f21b68a0 height=""300"">

  </picture>
</p>

We created several calibration (finding optimal confidence threshold) algorithms that allow adjusting models to specific use cases (cell types, magnifications, illumination settings, cameras etc.):
- Calibration using known number of objects on an image. Doesn't produce accuracy metrics.
- Calibration using fluorescent nuclei stain image (for example, DAPI image). Produces accuracy metrics.
- Calibration using manual annotation of nuclei. Produces accuracy metrics.

Apart from optimal confidence threshold search, these algorithms return accuracy metrics for specific use cases. Given that the calibration image is large, only part of it is used for search of threshold, while the second part is used for evaluation model's accuracy.
Accuracy metrics are [Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_percentage_error) and prediction-ground truth scatterplot, which shows how well model performs with different densities of cells.

## Cell Proliferation Measurement & Population Growth Analysis

With NuclePhaser you can reconstruct population growth curves from timelapse images of growing cell population by counting number of nuclei on each image. Key features of this approach are:

- No special equipment, reagents or dyes required, only regular culture plastic and cell growth medium, microscope with mechanical stage and a PC (even without GPU).
- [Accuracy measurement for each specific use case](https://napari-nuclephaser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/General%20information/Confidence%20threshold%20calibration.html), so you will be sure the tool is working with appropriate precision.
- Measuring the number of cells, not the area occupied by cells, which can be significantly influenced by spreading/narrowing of cells. 
- Complete reproducibility of results with metadata.txt files saved for each experiment.

## Individual cell tracking

NuclePhaser can be used as an assistant for individual cells tracking. This task is extremely difficult, and manual tracking is still the only method with 100% proof against false tracks. With NuclePhaser, you can significantly simplify manual tracking: instead of marking each cell on each image, you can predict nuclei location with NuclePhaser and then correct the result, which is **much** faster. Learn more in [documentation](https://napari-nuclephaser.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Biological%20tasks%20guidelines/Individual%20cells%20tracking.html).

Nyxus Napari is a Napari plugin for running feature calculations on image-segmentation image pairs, using the
Nyxus application to compute features. Nyxus is a feature-rich, highly optimized, Python/C++ application capable 
of analyzing images of arbitrary size and assembling complex regions of interest (ROIs) split across multiple image tiles and files. 

For more information on Nyxus, see https://github.com/PolusAI/nyxus.
 
# Installation 

To install Napari, it is recommended to first create a separate Conda environment. 

```
conda create -y -n napari-env -c conda-forge python=3.9
conda activate napari-env
```

After creating the Conda environment,
install Napari using pip

```
python -m pip install ""napari[all]""
python -m pip install ""napari[all]"" --upgrade
```

or using conda

```
conda install -c conda-forge napari
conda update napari
```

Next, Nyxus must be installed. Note that the version of Nyxus must be greater than or equal to `0.50` to run the Napari plugin.

`pip install nyxus`

or build from source using the instructions at https://github.com/PolusAI/nyxus#building-from-source using the conda build for the
python API.

After installing Napari and Nyxus, the Nyxus Napari plugin can be installed by cloning this repo and then building the plugin from the source. 
An example of this process is provided below.

```
git clone https://github.com/PolusAI/napari-nyxus.git
cd napari_nyxus
pip install -e .
```

Napari can then be ran by running 

```
napari
````

# Use
After installing the plugin, start Napari by running the command `napari` from the command line. Once the Napari 
GUI is loaded, the Nyxus plugin can be loaded from the `Plugins` menu in the toolbar by going to Plugins -> nyxus-napari.

![](https://github.com/PolusAI/napari-nyxus/raw/main/docs/source/img/plugin_menu.png)

A widget will appear in the Napari viewer to run Nyxus.

![](https://github.com/PolusAI/napari-nyxus/raw/main/docs/source/img/nyxus_loaded.png)

As shown by the example above, Nyxus will take in Intensity and Segmentation images. These parameters can either be a stack
of images or a single image pair. To load an image pair, use File -> Open File(s)... and select the images to load.

![](https://github.com/PolusAI/napari-nyxus/raw/main/docs/source/img/open_image.png)


Note that this method can also be used to open a stack of image, by using File -> Open Folder... instead of images. 

If the segmentation is loaded as an Image type in the napari viewer, it must first be converted to the Labels type. The image can converted as shown below.

![](https://github.com/PolusAI/napari-nyxus/raw/main/docs/source/img/convert_to_labels.png)

The loaded files can then be selected with the Intensity and Segmentation drop down menus. Other parameters can also be changed,
such as which features to calculate. For more information on the available features, see https://nyxus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/featurelist.html.

![](https://github.com/PolusAI/napari-nyxus/raw/main/docs/source/img/setup_calculation.png)

After running Nyxus, the feature calculations will also appear in the Napari viewer.

![](https://github.com/PolusAI/napari-nyxus/raw/main/docs/source/img/feature_results.png)

The Nyxus Napari plugin provides functionality to interact with the table containing the feature calculations. First, click on the segmentation image and then select `show selected` in the layer controls. 


Then, if a value is clicked in the `label` column of the table, the respective ROI will be highlighted in the segmentation image in the viewer.

![](https://github.com/PolusAI/napari-nyxus/raw/main/docs/source/img/click_label.png)

To select the ROI and have it added to a separate Labels image, the label in the table can be double clicked. Each double clicked label will be added to the same Labels image as show below. To unselect, the ROI, double click its respective label again.

![](https://github.com/PolusAI/napari-nyxus/raw/main/docs/source/img/double_click_label.png)

This feature can also be used in the opposite way, i.e. if an ROI is clicked in the segmentation image, the respective row in the 
feature table will be highlighted.

If one of the column headers are double clicked, a colormap will be generated in the Napari viewer showing the values of the features in the clicked
column. For example, if `Intensity` features are calculated, the `INTEGRATED_INTENSITY` column can be clicked and the colormap will appear.

![](https://github.com/PolusAI/napari-nyxus/raw/main/docs/source/img/feature_colormap.png)

Once the colormap is loaded, a slider will appear in the window with the minimum value being the minimum value of the feature colormap and the 
maximum value of the slider is the maximum value of the colormap. By adjusting the ranges in the slider, a new label image will appear in the viewer
that contains the ROIs who's features values fall within the slider values.

![](https://github.com/PolusAI/napari-nyxus/raw/main/docs/source/img/slider_feature.png)

The new labels resulting from the range slider selector can then be used to run Nyxus on by using the labels image as the `Segmentation` parameter.

![](https://github.com/PolusAI/napari-nyxus/raw/main/docs/source/img/run_on_colormap_labels.png)

# Limitations

While Nyxus Napari provides batched processing for large sets of images where each individual image will fit into RAM, 
it does not provide functionality to handle large single images that do not fit into RAM or that are larger than the 
limitations of Napari. For large images, it is recommended to install the Python or CLI version of Nyxus.

The ImageBrowser allows to zoom to a given well (""Go to well"") & puts a white bounding box around the selected well.

<img width=""1624"" alt=""navigator_2"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13ead72a-de0e-4b03-8051-b9759af4a131"">

Using prototype `condition tables` (to be defined better, see sample data provided by the plugin orthe example in the test data below), the ImageBrowser allows for selecting subsets of the well list based on conditions defined in the `condition table`. The [operetta-compose Fractal task package](https://github.com/leukemia-kispi/operetta-compose) provides a task to create such condition tables.


<img width=""1624"" alt=""navigator_3"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8cb9311-49ef-43fd-9358-4193ffb58877"">

The ROI loader (formerly [available separately as a napari plugin](https://github.com/jluethi/napari-ome-zarr-roi-loader)) can be used standalone or integrated with the ImageBrowser. If a well is selected from the ImageBrowser, all the images in that well can be loaded via the ROI loader.
This supports:
- Loading images from different multiplexing acquisitions
- Loading any ROI based on [Fractal ROI tables](https://fractal-analytics-platform.github.io/fractal-tasks-core/tables/#roi-tables)
- Loading label images
- Loading feature measurements (based on [Fractal feature tables](https://fractal-analytics-platform.github.io/fractal-tasks-core/tables/#feature-tables) in the AnnData format)

This approach of loading label images and feature data has been optimized for and tested with the [napari feature classifier](https://github.com/fractal-napari-plugins-collection/napari-feature-classifier).

<img width=""1624"" alt=""navigator_4"" src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0548c8f1-23c3-4c55-9388-c818bb94bbc3"">

This plugin is meant to work well for OME-Zarr files generated by [Fractal](https://fractal-analytics-platform.github.io/).

napari-OMAAS stands for **Optical Mapping Acquisition and Analysis Software** for panoramic heart imaging.

This napari plugin intends to be an analysis and acquisition tool for optical mapping in potentiometric (V<sub>m</sub>) or calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) fluorescence signals obtained from panoramic imaging of intact hearts.

 It supports reading images in `.sif` format and binary files generated from Andor Technologies cameras powered by the [sif_parser] python module.



<!-- ```{admonition} Experimental ❗️🐲🧪🔭🐗💣🚨🪲☣️❗️
:class: warning
This plugin is in early development/experimental stage so expect braking changes and bugs at anytime.
``` -->
## Examples

<br /> 

### Plot profile

The following example ilustrate how to perform normalization (pixelwise) on a time serie image and plot its 2d profile along the *t* dimension withing the averaged ROI selected pixels.

![](https://github.com/rjlopez2/napari-omaas/blob/documentation/example_imgs/Oct-31-2023%2016-45-55_plot_profile.gif?raw=true)

----------------------------------

### APD estimation 

The next example shows how to compute action potential duration (APD) in the same image stack.

![](https://github.com/rjlopez2/napari-omaas/blob/documentation/example_imgs/Oct-31-2023%2016-49-02_APD_analysis.gif?raw=true)

----------------------------------

You can also perform additional operations on images, such as normalization, temporal/spatial filters, segmentation, but also apply more advanced image processing methods such as motion tracking/compensation, etc.

----------------------------------

## Roadmap

-->

## Installation

[Install napari] if not already installed.

You can install `napari-ome-zarr` via [pip]. Activate the same environment as you installed napari into, then:

    pip install napari-ome-zarr

## Usage

Napari will use `napari-ome-zarr` plugin to open images that the plugin recognises as ome-zarr.
The image metadata from OMERO will be used to set channel names and rendering settings
in napari::

    napari ""https://uk1s3.embassy.ebi.ac.uk/idr/zarr/v0.3/9836842.zarr/""


If a dialog in napari pops up, encouraging you to choose a reader, choose ``napari-ome-zarr`` and click OK. You can stop it happening with addition of ``--plugin napari-ome-zarr`` as in the example below.

To open a local file::

    napari --plugin napari-ome-zarr 13457227.zarr

OR in python::

    import napari

    viewer = napari.Viewer()
    viewer.open(""https://uk1s3.embassy.ebi.ac.uk/idr/zarr/v0.4/idr0101A/13457537.zarr"", plugin=""napari-ome-zarr"")

    napari.run()

This package provides interoperability between the
[OMERO](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/omero/) image management platform, and
[napari](https://github.com/napari/napari): a fast, multi-dimensional image
viewer for python.

It provides a GUI interface for browsing an OMERO instance from within napari,
as well as command line interface extensions for both OMERO and napari CLIs.

![demo](https://github.com/tlambert03/napari-omero/blob/master/demo.gif?raw=true)

## Features

- GUI interface to browse remote OMERO data, with thumbnail previews.
- Loads remote nD images from an OMERO server into napari
- Upload annotsations (``Labels`, `Shapes` and `Points`) to OMERO.
- Planes are loading on demand as sliders are moved (""lazy loading"").
- Loading of pyramidal images as napari multiscale layers
- session management (login memory)
- OMERO rendering settings (contrast limits, colormaps, active channels, current
  Z/T position) are applied in napari

> [!NOTE]
> The user experience when working with remote images, particularly large multiscale (pyramidal) ones, like whole slide images, can be significantly improved by using napari 0.5.0 or newer and enabling the experimental asynchronous mode (n the GUI in `Preferences > Experimental > Render Images Asynchronously` or with the environmental variable `NAPARI_ASYNC=1`).

### as a napari dock widget

To launch napari with the OMERO browser added, [install](#installation) this
package and run:

```bash
napari-omero
```

The OMERO browser widget can also be manually added to the napari viewer using the Plugins menu
or programmatically using:

```python
import napari

viewer = napari.Viewer()
viewer.window.add_plugin_dock_widget('napari-omero')

napari.run()
```

### as a napari reader contribution

This package provides a napari reader contribution that accepts OMERO resources as
""proxy strings"" (e.g. `omero://Image:<ID>`) or as [OMERO webclient
URLS](https://help.openmicroscopy.org/urls-to-data.html).

```python
import napari
viewer = napari.Viewer()

# omero object identifier string
viewer.open(""omero://Image:1"", plugin=""napari-omero"")

# or URLS: https://help.openmicroscopy.org/urls-to-data.html
viewer.open(""http://yourdomain.example.org/omero/webclient/?show=image-314"", plugin=""napari-omero"")
```

these will also work on the napari command line interface, e.g.:

```bash
# quotes are needed if using zsh
napari ""omero://Image:1""
# or
napari ""http://yourdomain.example.org/omero/webclient/?show=image-314""
```

### as an OMERO CLI plugin

This package also serves as a plugin to the OMERO CLI

```bash
omero napari view Image:1
```

- ROIs created in napari can be saved back to OMERO via a ""Save ROIs"" button.
- napari viewer console has BlitzGateway 'conn' and 'omero_image' in context.

## installation

While this package supports anything above python 3.9,
In practice, python support is limited by `omero-py` and `zeroc-ice`,
compatibility, which is limited to python <=3.12 at the time of writing.

### from conda

It's easiest to install `omero-py` from conda, so the recommended procedure
is to install everything from conda, using the `conda-forge` channel.
For example, to install the plugin, napari, and the default Qt backend, use:

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge napari-omero pyqt
```

### from pip

`napari-omero` itself can be installed from pip, but you will still need
`omero-py`

```sh
conda create -n omero -c conda-forge python=3.10 omero-py
conda activate omero
pip install napari-omero[all]  # the [all] here is the same as `napari[all]`
```

## issues

| ❗  | This is alpha software & some things will be broken or sub-optimal!  |
| --- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |

- experimental & definitely still buggy!  [Bug
  reports](https://github.com/tlambert03/napari-omero/issues/new) are welcome!
- remote loading can be very slow still... though this is not strictly an issue
  of this plugin.  Datasets are wrapped as delayed dask stacks, and remote data
  fetching time can be significant.  Enabling [asynchronous
  rendering](https://napari.org/stable/guides/rendering.html#asynchronous-slicing) in
  napari improves the subjective performance... but remote data loading
  will likely always be a limitation here.
  To try asyncronous loading, start the program with `NAPARI_ASYNC=1 napari-omero`
  or look in the Preferences on the Experimental tab.
  Also, keep an eye on the [napari progressive loading implementation progress](https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/5561).
- For plugin developers: As napari-OMERO provides images as lazily-loaded [dask arrays](https://docs.dask.org/en/stable/array.html),
  napari-plugins need to account for this when retrieving data from napari layers.
  Keep in mind that forwarding the data to processing steps in plugins may lead to signficant loading
  and processing times.

## contributing

Contributions are welcome!  To get setup with a development environment:

```bash
# clone this repo:
git clone https://github.com/tlambert03/napari-omero.git
# change into the new directory
cd napari-omero
# create conda environment
conda env create -n napari-omero python=3.10 omero-py
# activate the new env
conda activate napari-omero

# install in editable mode with dev dependencies
pip install -e "".[dev]""      # quotes are needed on zsh
```

To maintain good code quality, this repo uses
[ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff),
[mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy).

To enforce code quality when you commit code, you can install pre-commit

```bash
# install pre-commit which will run code checks prior to commits
pre-commit install
```

The original OMERO data loader and CLI extension was created by [Will
Moore](https://github.com/will-moore).

The napari reader plugin and GUI browser was created by [Talley
Lambert](https://github.com/tlambert03/)

## release

To psuh a release to PyPI, one of the maintainers needs to do, for example:
```sh
git tag -a v0.2.0 -m v0.2.0
git push upstream --follow-tags
```
Then, the workflow should handle everything!

[Jump to Intallation](#installation)

----------------------------------

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/stable/plugins/index.html
-->

## Usage

napari-phasors is composed of a few widgets that allow reading a few specific FLIM and hyperspectral file formats, perform phasor analysis, and display and export the results of manual phasor selections.

### Sample Data

Two sample datasets for FLIM are provided, along with their corresponding calibration images. Additionally, a paramecium image is included as sample data for hyperspectral analysis.

![sample_data](https://github.com/napari-phasors/napari-phasors/raw/main/gifs/sample_data.gif)

### Phasor Analysis

#### Plot FLIM Data

FLIM phasor data can be plotted as a 2D histogram or scatter plot. The colormap, the number of bins and the scale of the colors can be customized.
Filtering and thresholding can also be applied to process phasor data and the mean intensity image. 

![phasors_flim](https://github.com/napari-phasors/napari-phasors/raw/main/gifs/phasors_flim.gif)

#### Plot Hyperspectral Data

Hyperspectral phasor data can also be plotted as a 2D histogram or scatter plot and visualized in the full universal circle.

![phasors_hyperspectral](https://github.com/napari-phasors/napari-phasors/raw/main/gifs/phasors_hyperspectral.gif)

### Apparent Lifetime Display

A FLIM image can be colormapped according to the phase or modulation apparent lifetime. A histogram is also created for visualization of the distribution of apparent lifetimes of the FLIM image.

![lifetimes](https://github.com/napari-phasors/napari-phasors/raw/main/gifs/lifetimes.gif)

### Phasor Calibration

FLIM images can be calibrated using a reference image acquired under the same experimental parameters. This reference image should consist of a homogeneous solution of a fluorophore with a known fluorescence lifetime and the laser frequency used in the experiment. This ensures accuracy and consistency in lifetime measurements.

![calibration](https://github.com/napari-phasors/napari-phasors/raw/main/gifs/calibration.gif)

### Phasor Custom Import

Supported file formats (`.tif`, `.ptu`, `.sdt`, `.fbd`, `.lsm`, `.ome.tif`) can be read and transformed to the phasor space. Additional options, such as the harmonics, channels and frames, can be specified depending on the file format to be read.

![custom_import](https://github.com/napari-phasors/napari-phasors/raw/main/gifs/custom_import.gif)

### Phasor Export

The average intensity image and the phasor coordinates can be exported as OME-TIF files that can be read by napari-phasors and PhasorPy. Alternatively, the phasor coordinates, as well as the selections (cursors) can be exported as a CSV file.

![export_phasors](https://github.com/napari-phasors/napari-phasors/raw/main/gifs/export_phasors.gif)

## Installation

You can install `napari-phasors` via [pip]. Follow these steps from a terminal.

We recommend using `miniforge` whenever possible. Click [here](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge?tab=readme-ov-file#miniforge) to choose the right download option for your OS.
**If you do not use `miniforge`, but rather Anaconda or Miniconda, replace the `mamba` term whenever you see it below with `conda`.**

Create a conda environment with napari by typing :

    mamba create -n napari-phasors-env napari pyqt python=3.10
    
Activate the environment :

    mamba activate napari-phasors-env

Install `napari-phasors` via [pip] :

    pip install napari-phasors

Alternatively, install latest development version with :

    pip install git+https://github.com/napari-phasors/napari-phasors.git

# PHILOW <br>
***P***ython-based platform for ***h***uman-***i***n-the-***lo***op (HITL)  ***w***orkflow (PHILOW) <br>

PHILOW is an interactive deep learning-based platform for 3D datasets implemented on top of [napari](https://github.com/napari/napari)

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/plugins/stable/index.html
-->

## Installation

Install napari and Pytorch first.   
See [napari] and [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) for more information.

You can install `napari-PHILOW` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-PHILOW
    
or clone this repository   
then
```angular2
cd PHILOW
pip install -e .
```
    

## Usage

Launch napari 

```angular2
napari
```


#### load dataset


1) Plugins > napari-PHILOW > Annotation Mode

2) Select original dir : all slices must be in separate 8bit PNG and must be sequentially numbered (e.g. 000.png, 001.png ...)

3) Select mask dir : To resume from the middle of the annotation, specify here the name of the directory containing the mask image. The directory must contain the same number of files with the same name as the original image.   
 If you are starting a completely new annotation, you do not need to specify a directory. The directory for mask is automatically created and blank images are generated and stored.

4) Enter a name for the label or model you want to create (e.g. mito, cristae, ...)   
This name will be used as the directory name of the newly created mask dir if no mask dir is specified, 
and as the name of the csv file for training dataset management.

5) Check if you want to create new dataset (new model)
When checked, if there is already a csv file for training dataset management, a new csv file with one sequential number will be generated.

6) Start tracing


#### create labels
Create a label with the brush function.
more information → https://napari.org/tutorials/fundamentals/labels.html

#### Orthogonal view
If you want to see orthogonal view, click on the location you want to see while holding down the Shift button.    
The image from xy, yz, and zx will be displayed on the right side of the screen.

#### Low confident layer
If you are in the second iteration and you are loading the prediction results, you will see a low confidence layer.    
This shows the area where the confidence of the prediction result is low.    
Use this as a reference for correction.   

#### Small object layer
We provide a small object layer to find small painted areas.   
This is a layer for displaying small objects.   
The slider widget on the left allows you to change the maximum object size to be displayed.   

#### save labels
If you want to save your label, click the ""save"" button on the bottom right.

#### select training dataset
We are providing a way to manage the dataset for use in training.   
If you want to use the currently displayed slice as your training data, click the 'Not Checked' button near the center left to display 'Checked'.

## About
This napari plugin was developed in partnership with CFIM (Centre for Microscopy and Image Analysis, Copenhagen University).

The plugin enables image analysis for microscopy, focused on identifying pits and segmenting cells, then generating detailed statistics. It is tailored for using `.czi` files and integrates well with the [`napari-czi-reader`](https://github.com/MaxusTheOne/napari-czi-reader).

For training the VGG19 2_2 × Random Forest Classifier used in this plugin, visit the [pitcount-ml-training](https://github.com/MaxusTheOne/pitcount-ml-training) repository.

## Features
- Detects pits in images using a trained `torchvision` model.
- Performs cell segmentation via Cellpose (default model: `cyto3`).
- Calculates and outputs statistics such as:
  - Total cell count
  - Total pit count
  - Percentage of cells containing pits
  - Average number of pits per cell

## Usage

### Graphical Mode (GUI)
You can launch the plugin in napari with:
```bash
napari-pitcount-cfim --dev
```
or open napari and activate the plugin manually.
## Headless Mode (NO GUI)
```bash
napari-pitcount-cfim --no-gui 
```
Run --help to list all options:
```bash
napari-pitcount-cfim --no-gui -h
```
## Command-Line Arguments
| Argument            | Alias | Type      | Description                                                                            |
| ------------------- | ----- | --------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--no-gui`          |       | flag      | Runs the pipeline without GUI. Required for headless automation.                       |
| `--dev`             |       | flag      | Launches napari in developer mode for plugin debugging.                                |
| `--verbosity`       | `-v`  | int (0–2) | Sets the level of console output. Default: `0`.                                        |
| `--input-folder`    | `-i`  | str       | Input directory for image data (required with `--no-gui`).                             |
| `--output-folder`   | `-o`  | str       | Directory to save results. Default: `'output'`.                                        |
| `--pit-mask-folder` | `-p`  | path      | If specified, skips pit prediction and uses this directory for pit masks.              |
| `--save-raw-data`   |       | flag      | Saves raw, unprocessed data to the output folder (only in `--no-gui` mode).            |
| `--family-grouping` |       | str       | Grouping method for output: `default`, `file`, `folder`, or `all`. Default: `default`. |

## Notes
- --input-folder must be used with --no-gui.

- --pit-mask-folder must be a valid existing directory.

- Set environment variables are used internally to control behavior.

## Requirements
Napari recommends installing napari seperately, as it is not included in this package. You can install it with:
```bash
pip install napari[all]
```
Or you can just
```bash
pip install napari-pitcount-cfim[napari]
```

## Known Issues
- The plugin might not support the formats of most model output.
- It's not possible to link masks directly to images in the GUI.
- The default pit model, is a stub and mostly for decoration.

Plugin to correct manually pixel wrongly predicted on image by annotation

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

This plugin allows you to manually correct the images of the apple tree flowers by annotation. Below, a piece of an image shows the predicted pixels (in brown). A pixel in brown is assigned to the flower class. We can see that the brown colour does not necessarily cover a flower in this image.

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/stable/plugins/index.html
-->

## Installation

You can install `napari-pixel-correction` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-pixel-correction



To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/hereariim/napari-pixel-correction.git

## How does it work

First, you need a compressed file (in .zip format) were you have all your images. For a compressed file named as `input.zip`, the compressed file should be built like :

```
.
└── input.zip
    └── repository
        ├── image
        │   ├── im_1.JPG
        │   ├── im_2.JPG  
        │   ├── im_3.JPG
        │   ...
        │   └── im_n.JPG
        │
        └── mask
            ├── im_1_mask.JPG
            ├── im_2_mask.JPG
            ├── im_3_mask.JPG
            ...
            └── im_n_mask.JPG
```
In repository, each image folder should have two elements : image in RGB and the segmented mask in binary image (where no-flower class is 0 and flower class is 255)

A **Napari** plugin for extracting time series traces from single molecule FRET data.

napari-PixSeq uses **Picasso** (picassosr) as a backend and includes features for **aligning** image channels/datasets, **undrifting** images, **detecting/fitting** localisations and extracting **traces**, and supports both **ALEX** and **FRET** data. Traces can be exported in different formats for downstream analysis.

napari-PixSeq traces can be analysed with TraceAnalyser: https://github.com/piedrro/TraceAnalyser

This is still undergoing development, so some features may not work as expected.

This was built by Dr Piers Turner from the Kapanidis Lab, University of Oxford.

Unmix spectral spillover

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72306584/176486552-50e1bca9-65fd-4466-8c92-a114e48d2278.gif)

## Automatic Usage

You can find the `PICASSO` plugin in the menu `Plugins > napari-PICASSO: PICASSO`. Select sink images that have spectral spillover from corresponding source images, then click run to optimise the mixing parameters with PICASSO. 

## Manual Usage

![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72306584/176505151-572bd762-abe6-47b1-9821-4f3aaa4704c9.gif)

Select the manual button in options pop up window. Then select sink images that have spectral spillover from corresponding source images. In the source images window, sliders for each $source$ control the mixing spillover, $m$ (top), and background, $b$ (bottom, optional).

## Mixing model

$$ sink = \sum_{i} m_i(source - b_i) $$

## Installation

You can install `napari-PICASSO` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-PICASSO

## Details

napari-PICASSO is a napari widget to blindly unmix fluorescence images of known members using PICASSO<sup>1</sup>. 

For example, if 2 fluorophores with overlapping spectra are imaged, spillover fluorescesce from a channel into an adjacent channel could be removed if you know which channel is the source of the spillover fluorescence and which channel is the sink of the spillover fluorescence. 

PICASSO is an algorithm to remove spillover fluorescence by minimizing the mutual information between sink and source images. The original algorithm described by Seo et al, minimized the mutual information between pairs of sink and source images using a Nelson-Mead simplex algorithm and computing the mutual information outright with custom written MATLAB code<sup>1</sup>. The napari plugin uses a neural net to estimate and minimize the mutual information (MINE<sup>2</sup>) between pairs of sink and source images using stochastic gradient descent with GPU acceleration.

Plugin providing support for 1d plotting in napari.

This plugin is in very early stages of development and many things are still in a state of disarray. New features and bug fixes
will be coming over the coming months. 

## Note

`napari-plot` provides several custom icons and stylesheets to take advantage of the `Qt` backend. Since it would be a bit busy to add multiple layer lists,
I opted to include a toolbar that quickly pulls the layer list whenever requested. Simple use the toolbar to access several commonly accessed elements.

## Usage

You can use `napari-plot` alongside `napari` where it is embedded as a dock widget. If using this option, controls are relegated to toolbar
where you can adjust layer properties like you would do in `napari`.

![embedded](https://github.com/lukasz-migas/napari-1d/blob/main/misc/embedded.png)

Or as a standalone app where only one-dimensional plotting is enabled. In this mode, controls take central stage and reflect `napari's` own
behaviour where layer controls are embedded in the main application.

![live-view](https://github.com/lukasz-migas/napari-1d/blob/main/misc/napariplot-live-line.gif)

## Roadmap:

This is only provisional list of features that I would like to see implemented. It barely scratches the surface of what plotting tool should cover so as soon as the basics are covered,
focus will be put towards adding more exotic features. If there are features that you certainly wish to be included,
please modify the list below or create a [new issue](https://github.com/lukasz-migas/napari-1d/issues/new)

- [ ] Support for new layer types. Layers are based on `napari's` `Layer`, albeit in a two-dimensional setting. Supported and planned layers:
  - [x] Line Layer - simple line plot.
  - [x] Scatter Layer - scatter plot (similar to `napari's Points` layer).
  - [x] Centroids/Segments Layer - horizontal or vertical line segments.
  - [x] InfLine Layer - infinite horizontal or vertical lines that span over very broad range. Useful for defining regions of interest.
  - [x] Region Layer - infinite horizontal or vertical rectangular boxes that span over very broad range. Useful for defining regions of interest.
  - [x] Shapes Layer - `napari's` own `Shapes` layer
  - [x] Points Layer - `napari's` own `Points` layer
  - [x] Multi-line Layer - more efficient implementation of `Line` layer when multiple lines are necessary.
  - [ ] Bar - horizontal and vertical barchart (TODO)
- [x] Proper interactivity of each layer type (e.g. moving `Region` or `InfLine`, adding points, etc...)
- [x] Intuitive interactivity. `napari-plot` will provide excellent level of interactivity with the plotted data. We plan to support several types of `Tools` that permit efficient interrogation of the data. We currently provide several `zoom` and `select` tools and hope to add few extras in the future.
  - [x] Box-zoom - standard zooming rectangle. Simply `left-mouse + drag/release` in the canvas on region of interest
  - [x] Horizontal span - zoom-in only in the y-axis by `Ctrl + left-mouse + drag/release` in the canvas.
  - [x] Vertical span - span-in only in the x-axis by `Shift + left-mouse + drag/release` in the canvas.
  - [x] Rectangle select - rectangle tool allowing sub-selection of data in the canvas. Similar to the `Box-zoom` but without the zooming part.
  - [x] Polygon select - polygon tool allowing sub-selection of data in the canvas.
  - [x] Lasso select - lasso tool allowing sub-selection of data in the canvas.
- [ ] Interactive plot legend
- [ ] Customizable axis visuals.
  - [x] Plot axis enabling customization of tick/label size and color
  - [ ] Support for non-linear scale
- [ ] Add convenient plotting interface:
  - [ ] Add `.plot` functionality
  - [ ] Add `.scatter` functionality
  - [ ] Add `.hbar` and `.vbar` functionality
  - [ ] Add `.imshow` functionality

## Plot a Line Profile

Plot intensities along a line in [napari].

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-plot-profile/raw/main/docs/napari-plot-profile-screencast.gif)

* Open some images in [napari].
  
* Add a shapes layer.

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-plot-profile/raw/main/docs/add_shapes_layer_screenshot.png)
  
* Activate the line drawing tool or the path tool and draw a line.

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-plot-profile/raw/main/docs/draw_line_tool_screenshot.png)
  
* After drawing a line, click on the menu Plugins > Measurements (Plot Profile)
* If you modify the line, you may want to click the ""Refresh"" button to redraw the profile.

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-plot-profile/raw/main/docs/redraw_screenshot.png)

To see how these steps can be done programmatically from python, check out the [demo notebook](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-plot-profile/blob/main/docs/demo.ipynb)

## Create a Topographical View

Create a 3D view of a 2D image by warping pixel intensities to heights. It can be displayed as a 3D image layer, a points cloud layer or a surface layer.

**NOTE: PRISM is still in heavy development.**
PRISM or napari-prism is a package and [napari] plugin designed for interactively processing, analysing and visualising multiplxed tissue microarrays.

Currently, end-to-end capabilities (i.e. starting from importing the raw image file, to basic spatial analysis of annotated cells) are available for images generated from the
Akoya Phenocycler™-Fusion platform. However, the modular structure of the
package allows for usage at any stage of processing and/or analysis, given a pre-built SpatialData object using readers from either
[spatialdata-io] or [sopa].

PRISM uses [spatialdata] as the core data framework, allowing for:

1. The rich integration of tools from the ([scverse]) Python bioinformatics ecosystem with highly interactive graphical user interfaces from [napari] and [napari-spatialdata].
2. The storage of images, shapes, annotations and their linked `AnnData` objects in a standardized, FAIR-compliant data structure, addressing the non-standard and fragmented organization of files before, during, and after a multiplexed image analysis pipeline.

The package was designed to be used completely within the [napari] application and therefore require little to no knowledge of Python programming. Documentation for usage via the API is currently in progress.

## Requirements

Install [miniconda] or anaconda.

Open the conda terminal and create a simple environment:

```bash
conda create -n prism python=3.10 -c conda-forge
```

Activate the environment before executing the instructions in the Installation section.

```bash
conda activate prism
```

## Installation: GPU-accelerated

### General computations with RAPIDS and rapids-singlecell

General larger scale and/or computationally demanding functions can be accelerated with the [NVIDIA RAPIDS suite](https://rapids.ai/). We utilise some packages from this suite, as well as the GPU-accelerated implementation of scanpy with [rapids-singlecell].

1. [Check and configure the system requirements from RAPIDS](https://docs.rapids.ai/install/#system-req).
    - Currently, only Linux distributions (or Windows systems with WSL2) are supported.
    - Install the [CUDA12.2](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-2-2-download-archive) or [CUDA12.5](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-5-1-download-archive) toolkit.
2. Install the package together with [RAPIDS] and [rapids-singlecell] via [pip]:

```bash
pip install napari-prism[gpu] --extra-index-url=https://pypi.nvidia.com

Powerful `magicgui` widgets and type annotations for general-purpose napari plugin development.

`napari-power-widgets` makes the full use of type-to-widget mapping strategy of `magicgui` to provide napari-specific types and value-widgets, which will be very useful to improve UI/UX of your napari plugins with simple codes.

Currently, `napari-power-widgets` does not provide any reader, writer or widget. It is supposed to be used programmatically.

### Examples

Some types/widgets and the possible usage are picked up here ([&rarr; check all](https://github.com/hanjinliu/napari-power-widgets/blob/main/src/napari_power_widgets/types.py)). If you have any neat ideas, please open an issue.

#### 1. `BoxSelection`

Alias of a four-float tuple for 2D selection. You can set the value by drawing a interaction box in the viewer.

*e. g. : image cropper, rectangular labeling etc.*

```python
@magicgui
def f(box: BoxSelection):
    print(box)
viewer.window.add_dock_widget(f)
```

![](images/BoxSelection.gif)

#### 2. `OneOfRectangles`

Alias of `np.ndarray` for one of rectangles in a `Shapes` layer.

*e. g. : image cropper, rectangular labeling etc.*

```python
@magicgui
def f(rect: OneOfRectangles):
    print(rect)
viewer.window.add_dock_widget(f)
```

![](images/OneOfRectangles.gif)

#### 3. `LineData`

Alias of `np.ndarray` for a line data. You can obtain the data by manually drawing a line in the viewer.

*e. g. : line profiling, kymograph etc.*

```python
@magicgui
def f(line: LineData):
    print(line)
viewer.window.add_dock_widget(f)
```

![](images/LineData.gif)

#### 4. `OneOfLabels`

Alias of boolean `np.ndarray` for a labeled region. You can choose ones by directly clicking the viewer.

*e. g. : image masking, feature measurement etc.*

```python
@magicgui
def f(label: OneOfLabels):
    pass
viewer.window.add_dock_widget(f)
```

![](images/OneOfLabels.gif)


#### 5. `ZRange`

Alias of a tuple of float that represents the limit of the third dimension. You can select the values by moving the dimension slider.

*e. g. : movie trimming, partial image projection etc.*

```python
@magicgui
def f(zrange: ZRange):
    print(zrange)
viewer.window.add_dock_widget(f)
```

Process and analyze surfaces using [vedo](https://vedo.embl.es/) in [napari].

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-process-points-and-surfaces/raw/main/docs/graphical_abstract.gif)
The nppas gastruloid example is derived from [AV Luque and JV Veenvliet (2023)](https://zenodo.org/record/7603081) which is licensed [CC-BY](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode) and can be downloaded from here: https://zenodo.org/record/7603081

## Usage

You find menus for surface generation, smoothing and analysis in the menu `Tools > Surfaces` and `Tools > Points`. 
For detailed explanation of the underlying algorithms, please refer to the [vedo](https://vedo.embl.es/) documentation.

For processing meshes in Python scripts, see the [demo notebook](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-process-points-and-surfaces/blob/main/docs/demo.ipynb). 
There you also learn how this screenshot is made:

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-process-points-and-surfaces/raw/main/docs/screenshot5.png)

For performing quantitative measurements of surface in Python scripts, see the [demo notebook](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-process-points-and-surfaces/blob/main/docs/quality_measurements.ipynb). 
There you also learn how this screenshot is made:

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-process-points-and-surfaces/raw/main/docs/screenshot6.png)

### Surface measurements and annotations

Using the menu `Tools > Measurement tables > Surface quality table (vedo, nppas)` you can derive quantiative measurements of
the vertices in a given surface layer. 

![img_1.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-process-points-and-surfaces/raw/main/docs/surface_measurements2.png)

To differentiate regions when analyzing those measurements it is recommended to use the menu `Tools > Surfaces > Annotate surface manually (nppas)`
after measurements have been made. This tool allows you to draw annotation label values on the surface. 
It is recommended to do activate a colorful colormap such as `hsv` before starting to draw annotations. 
Furthermore, set the maximum of the contrast limit range to the number of regions you want to annotate + 1.
Annotations can be drawn as freehand lines and circles.

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-process-points-and-surfaces/raw/main/docs/surface_annotation2.png)

After measurements and annotations were done, you can save the annotation in the same measurement table using the menu
`Tools > Measurement tables > Surface quality/annotation to table (nppas)`

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-process-points-and-surfaces/raw/main/docs/surface_annotation_in_table2.png)

For classifying surface vertices using machine learning, please refer to the [napari APOC](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification) documentation.

### Measurement visualization

To visualize measurements on the surface, just double-click on the table column headers.

## Installation

You can install `napari-process-points-and-surfaces` via mamba/conda and pip:

```
mamba install vedo vtk libnetcdf=4.7.4 -c conda-forge
pip install napari-process-points-and-surfaces
```

### Troubleshooting: Open3d installation

Since version 0.4.0, `nppas` does no longer depend on [open3d](http://www.open3d.org/). 
Some deprecated functions still use Open3d though. 
Follow the installation instructions in the [open3d documentation](http://www.open3d.org/docs/release/getting_started.htm) to install it and keep using those functions.
Also consider updating code and no longer using these deprecated functions. 
See [release notes](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-process-points-and-surfaces/releases/tag/0.4.0) for details.

Alternatively, you can follow my instructions as follows:

You will need a python environment. I recommend [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html). Create a new environment, for example:
    
    conda create --name napari-env python=3.7 pip 

Activate the new environment:

    conda activate napari-env 

Install [napari](https://napari.org/tutorials/fundamentals/installation) via [pip]:

    pip install napari[all]

Then you can finally install our plugin `napari-pram` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-pram

Alternatively, the plugin can be installed using napari-GUI

``[Plugins] > Install/Uninstall Plugins`` and search for `napari-pram`

A plugin for the simulation of the 3D Point Spread Function of an optical systen, particularly a microscope objective.
 
Calculates the PSF using scalar and vectorial models.  
The following aberrations are included:
- phase aberration described by a Zernike polynomials with n-m coefficients.
- aberration induced by a slab, with a refractive index different from the one at the object.  

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/plugins/stable/index.html
-->

## Installation

You can install `napari-psf-simulator` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-psf-simulator


To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/andreabassi78/napari-psf-simulator.git


## Usage

1) Lauch the plugin and select the parameters of the microscope: `NA` (numerical aperture), `wavelenght`, `n` (refractive index at the object),
   `FOV xy` (field of view in the transverse direction), `FOV z` (field of view in the axial direction), `dxy` (pixel size, transverse sampling), `dz` (voxel depth, axial sampling), `lens radius` (physical aperture of the lens, used in vectorial model)

2) Select a propagation model between `scalar` and `vectorial`.  

3) Select an aberration type (if needed).

4) Press `Calculate PSF` to run the simulator. This will create a new image layer with the 3D PSF.
 
   The option `Show Airy disk` creates a circle with radius given by the diffraction limit (Rayleigh criterion).

## Detailed documentation

An exhaustive documentation of the use of the plugin on scalar and vectoral propagation models can be found in [this] presentation.

A detailed explanation of the uses and advantages that simulating a PSF brings can be found [here].

The vectorial propagation model implements a secondary library: [pyfocus](https://github.com/fcaprile/PyFocus). The full documentation of this library can be found at [read the docs](https://pyfocus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and in the paper: ""PyFocus: A Python package for vectorial calculations of focused optical fields under realistic conditions. Application to toroidal foci."" https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2022.108315

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome. Tests can be run with [tox], please ensure
the coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request. 
The plugin has been concived to be modular allowing the insertion of new aberations and pupils. Please contact the developers on github for adding new propagations and aberrations types. 
Any suggestions or contributions are welcome.

Napari plugin for reading videos using [PyAV](https://github.com/PyAV-Org/PyAV). Inspired by the [napari-video](https://github.com/janclemenslab/napari-video) project, which served us very well for many years. For some long videos, however, its dependency on opencv caused seek glitches, so we implemented this alternative plugin based on PyAV.

![application_screenshot](figs/napari-psf-analysis_demo.gif)
<!-- start abstract -->
A plugin to analyse point spread functions (PSFs) of optical systems.
<!-- end abstract -->
## Usage
### Starting Point
To run a PSF analysis open an image of acquired beads. Add a point-layer
and indicate the beads you want to measure by adding a point.

### Run Analysis
Open the plugin (Plugins > napari-psf-analysis > PSF Analysis) and ensure
that your bead image and point layers are select in the `Basic` tab under
`Image` and `Points` respectively.
In the `Advanced` tab further information can be provided. Only the filled
in fields of the `Advanced` tab are saved in the output.

After verifying all input fields click `Extract PSFs`.

### Discard and Save Measurement
Once the PSF extraction has finished a new layer (`Analyzed Beads`) appears,
holding a summary
image for every selected bead.
Individual summaries can be discarded by clicking the `Delete Displayed
Measurement` button.

Results are saved to the selected `Save Dir` by clicking the `Save
Measurements` button.

Note: Beads for which the bounding box does not fit within the image are
automatically excluded from the analysis and no output is generated.


### Saved Data
Every image of the `Analyzed Beads` layer is saved as `{source_image_name}_X
{bead-centroid-x}_Y{bead-centroid-y}_Z{bead-centroid-z}.png` file.
Additionally a `PSFMeasurement_{source_image_acquisition_date}_
{source_image_name}_{microscope_name}_{magnification}_{NA}.csv` file is
stored containing the measured values and all filled in fields.

---
<!-- start install -->
## Installation
We recommend installation into a fresh conda environment.

### 1. Install napari
```shell
conda create -y -n psf-analysis -c conda-forge python=3.9

conda activate psf-analysis

conda install -c conda-forge napari pyqt
```

### 2. Install napari-aicsimageio and bioformats
Required if you want to open other files than `.tif` e.g. `.stk. `.

__Note:__ See [napari-aicsimageio](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-aicsimageio) for more information about opening images.
```shell
conda install -c conda-forge openjdk bioformats_jar ""aicsimageio[all]"" napari-aicsimageio

conda deactivate
conda activate psf-analysis
```

### 3. Install napari-psf-analysis
You can install `napari-psf-analysis` via [pip]:

```shell
python -m pip install xmlschema
python -m pip install napari-psf-analysis
```

### 4. Optional `Set Config`
You can provide a config yaml file with the available microscope names and a default save directory.
This will change the `Microscope` text field to a drop down menu and change the default save directory.

`example_config.yaml`
```yaml
microscopes:
  - TIRF
  - Zeiss Z1
output_path: ""D:\\psf_analysis\\measurements""
```

To use this config navigate to `Plugins > napari-psf-analysis > Set Config` and select the config file.

__Note:__ The save path is OS specific.

Robust image registration for napari.

## Summary
napari-pystackreg offers the image registration capabilities of the python package
[pystackreg](https://github.com/glichtner/pystackreg) for napari.

![](https://github.com/glichtner/napari-pystackreg/raw/main/docs/napari-pystackreg.gif)

## Description

pyStackReg is used to align (register) one or more images to a common reference image, as is required usually in
time-resolved fluorescence or wide-field microscopy.
It is directly ported from the source code of the ImageJ plugin ``TurboReg`` and provides additionally the
functionality of the ImageJ plugin ``StackReg``, both of which were written by Philippe Thevenaz/EPFL
(available at http://bigwww.epfl.ch/thevenaz/turboreg/).

pyStackReg provides the following five types of distortion:

- Translation
- Rigid body (translation + rotation)
- Scaled rotation (translation + rotation + scaling)
- Affine (translation + rotation + scaling + shearing)
- Bilinear (non-linear transformation; does not preserve straight lines)

pyStackReg supports the full functionality of StackReg plus some additional options, e.g., using different reference
images and having access to the actual transformation matrices (please see the examples below). Note that pyStackReg
uses the high quality (i.e. high accuracy) mode of TurboReg that uses cubic spline interpolation for transformation.

Please note: The bilinear transformation cannot be propagated, as a combination of bilinear transformations does not
generally result in a bilinear transformation. Therefore, stack registration/transform functions won't work with
bilinear transformation when using ""previous"" image as reference image. You can either use another reference (
""first"" or ""mean"" for first or mean image, respectively), or try to register/transform each image of the stack
separately to its respective previous image (and use the already transformed previous image as reference for the
next image).

## Installation

## Usage


### Open Plugin User Interface

Start up napari, e.g. from the command line:

    napari

Then, load an image stack (e.g. via ``File > Open Image...``) that you want to register. You can also use the example
stack provided by the pluging (``File > Open Sample > napari-pystackreg: PC12 moving example``).
Then, select the ``napari-pystackreg`` plugin from the ``Plugins > napari-pystackreg: pystackreg`` menu.

![](https://github.com/glichtner/napari-pystackreg/raw/main/docs/ui-initial.png)

### User Interface Options
A variety of options are available to control the registration process:

* `Image Stack`: The image layer that should be registered/transformed.
* `Transformation`: The type of transformation that should be applied.
  - `Translation`: translation
  - `Rigid body`: translation + rotation
  - `Scaled rotation`: translation + rotation + scaling
  - `Affine`: translation + rotation + scaling + shearing
  - `Bilinear`: non-linear transformation; does not preserve straight lines
* `Reference frame:` The reference image for registration.
  - `Previous frame`: Aligns each frame (image) to its previous frame in the stack
  - `Mean (all frames)`: Aligns each frame (image) to the average of all images in the stack
  - `Mean (first n frames)`: Aligns each frame (image) to the mean of the first n frames in the stack. n is a tuneable parameter.
* `Moving-average stack before register`: Apply a moving average to the stack before registration. This can be useful to
  reduce noise in the stack (if the signal-to-noise ratio is very low). The moving average is applied to the stack only
  for determining the transformation matrices, but not for the actual transforming of the stack.
* `Transformation matrix file`: Transformation matrices can be saved to or loaded from a file for permanent storage.

### Reference frame
The reference frame is the frame to which the other frames are aligned. The default option is to use the
`Previous frame`, which will register each frame to its respective previous frame in the stack. Alternatively, the
reference frame can be set to the mean of all frames in the stack (`Mean (all frames)`) or the mean of the first n
frames in the stack (`Mean (first n frames)`). The latter option can be useful if the first frames in the stack are more
stable than the later frames (e.g. if the first frames are taken before the sample is moved). When selecting the
`Mean (first n frames)` option, the number of frames to use for the mean can be set via the spinbox below the option.

![](https://github.com/glichtner/napari-pystackreg/raw/main/docs/ui-reference-mean-n.png)

### Moving average before registration
To increase registration performance with low signal-to-noise ratio stacks, a moving average can be applied to the
stack before registration. The moving average is applied to the stack only for determining the
transformation matrices, but not for the actual transforming of the stack. That means that the transformed stack will
still contain the original frames (however registered), but not the averaged frames.

When selecting the `Moving-average stack before register` option, the number of frames to use for the moving average can
be set via the spinbox below the option.

![](https://github.com/glichtner/napari-pystackreg/raw/main/docs/ui-moving-average.png)

### Transformation matrix file
The transformation matrices can be saved to or loaded from a file for permanent storage. This can be useful if you want
to apply the same transformation to another stack (e.g. a different channel of the same sample). The transformation
matrices are saved as a numpy array in a binary file (``.npy``). The file can be loaded via the `Load` button and saved
via the `Save` button.

![](https://github.com/glichtner/napari-pystackreg/raw/main/docs/ui-register-tmat.png)

### Register/Transform
To perform the actual registration and transformation steps, click the `Register` and `Transform` buttons, respectively.

The `Register` button will register the stack to the reference by determining the appropriate transformation matrices,
without actually transforming the stack. The transformation matrices can be saved to a file via the `Save` button in the
`Transformation matrix file` section.

![](https://github.com/glichtner/napari-pystackreg/raw/main/docs/ui-registered.png)

The `Transform` button (1) will transform the stack to the reference by applying the transformation matrices that are
currently loaded to the stack selected in `Image Stack`. For the button to become active, either the transformation
matrices have to be loaded from a file via the `Load` button in the `Transformation matrix file` section, or the
`Register` button has to be clicked first to determine the transformation matrices.

The `Transform` button will also add a new image layer to the napari viewer (2) with the transformed stack. The name of the
new layer will be the name of the original stack with the prefix `Registered`.

![](https://github.com/glichtner/napari-pystackreg/raw/main/docs/ui-transformed.png)

Finally, the `Register & Transform` button will perform both the registration and transformation steps in one go.

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/322312181.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/322312181)

The py-clEsperanto-assistant is a yet experimental [napari](https://github.com/napari/napari) plugin for building GPU-accelerated image processing workflows. 
It is part of the [clEsperanto](http://clesperanto.net) project and thus, aims at removing programming language related barriers between image processing ecosystems in the life sciences. 
It uses [pyclesperanto](https://github.com/clEsperanto/pyclesperanto_prototype) and with that [pyopencl](https://documen.tician.de/pyopencl/) as backend for processing images.

This napari plugin adds some menu entries to the Tools menu. You can recognize them with their suffix `(clEsperanto)` in brackets.
Furthermore, it can be used from the [napari-assistant](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-assistant) graphical user interface. 
Therefore, just click the menu `Tools > Utilities > Assistant (na)` or run `naparia` from the command line.

![](https://github.com/clEsperanto/napari_pyclesperanto_assistant/raw/master/docs/images/virtual_4d_support1.gif)

## Usage

### Start up the assistant
Start up napari, e.g. from the command line:
```
napari
```

Load example data, e.g. from the menu `File > Open Samples > clEsperanto > CalibZAPWfixed` and 
start the assistant from the menu `Tools > Utilities > Assistant (na)`.

![](https://github.com/clEsperanto/napari_pyclesperanto_assistant/raw/master/docs/images/screenshot1.png)

In case of two dimensional timelapse data, an initial conversion step might be necessary depending on your data source. 
Click the menu `Tools > Utilities > Convert to 2d timelapse`. In the dialog, select the dataset and click ok. 
You can delete the original dataset afterwards:

![](https://github.com/clEsperanto/napari_pyclesperanto_assistant/raw/master/docs/images/screenshot1a.png)

### Set up a workflow

Choose categories of operations in the top right panel, for example start with denoising using a Gaussian Blur with sigma 1 in x and y.

![](https://github.com/clEsperanto/napari_pyclesperanto_assistant/raw/master/docs/images/screenshot2.png)

Continue with background removal using the top-hat filter with radius 5 in x and y.

![](https://github.com/clEsperanto/napari_pyclesperanto_assistant/raw/master/docs/images/screenshot2a.png)

For labeling the objects, use [Voronoi-Otsu-Labeling](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/clEsperanto/pyclesperanto_prototype/blob/master/demo/segmentation/voronoi_otsu_labeling.ipynb) with both sigma parameters set to 2.

![](https://github.com/clEsperanto/napari_pyclesperanto_assistant/raw/master/docs/images/screenshot2b.png)

The labeled objects can be extended using a Voronoi diagram to derive a estimations of cell boundaries.

![](https://github.com/clEsperanto/napari_pyclesperanto_assistant/raw/master/docs/images/screenshot2c.png)

You can then configure napari to show the label boundaries on top of the original image:

![](https://github.com/clEsperanto/napari_pyclesperanto_assistant/raw/master/docs/images/screenshot2d.png)

When your workflow is set up, click the play button below your dataset:

![](https://github.com/clEsperanto/napari_pyclesperanto_assistant/raw/master/docs/images/timelapse_2d.gif)

### Neighbor statistics

When working with 2D or 3D data you can analyze measurements in relationship with their neighbors. 
For example, you can measure the area of blobs as shown in the example shown below using the menu 
`Tools > Measurements > Statistics of labeled pixels (clesperant)` and visualize it as `area` image by double-clicking on the table column (1).
Additionally, you can measure the maximum area of the 6 nearest neighbors using the menu `Tools > Measurments > Neighborhood statistics of measurements`.
The new column will then be called ""max_nn6_area..."" (2). When visualizing such parametric images next by each other, it is recommended to use
[napari-brightness-contrast](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-brightness-contrast) and visualize the same intensity range to see differences correctly.

![](https://github.com/clEsperanto/napari_pyclesperanto_assistant/raw/master/docs/images/neighbor_statistics.png)

### Code generation
You can also export your workflow as Python/Jython code or as notebook. See the [napari-assistant documentation](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-assistant) for details.

## Features
[pyclesperanto](https://github.com/clEsperanto/pyclesperanto_prototype) offers various possibilities for processing images.

# napari-rembg

Segment images using a collection of fast and lightweight generalist segmentation models in Napari. This plugin is based on the [rembg](https://github.com/danielgatis/rembg) project.

![demo](./assets/demo.gif)

**Key features**

- Choose among **five generalist segmentation models**, including SAM (Segment Anything Model).
- Quickly annotate individual objects by drawing **bounding boxes** around them.
- Possibility to generate predictions via a remote **web API** and keep the installation lightweight on client machines.
- Compatible with 2D, RGB, 2D+t, and 3D images (slice by slice).

## Installation

You can install `napari-rembg` via [pip]. If you wish to use your local machine for the predictions (most users):

    pip install ""napari-rembg[local]""

If you wish to generate predictions from a [web api](#running-the-segmentation-via-a-web-api), go for a minimal install:

    pip install napari-rembg

## Models

- [u2net](https://github.com/xuebinqin/U-2-Net): A pre-trained model for general use cases.
- [u2netp](https://github.com/xuebinqin/U-2-Net): A lightweight version of u2net.
- [silueta](https://github.com/xuebinqin/U-2-Net/issues/295): Same as u2net with a size reduced to 43 Mb.
- [isnet](https://github.com/xuebinqin/DIS): A pre-trained model for general use cases.
- [sam](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything): Segment Anything Model pre-trained for any use cases (`vit_b`)

![models](./assets/comparison.png)

The models automatically get downloaded in the user's home folder in the `.u2net` directory the first time inference is run.

## Usage

Start `napari-rembg` from the `Plugins` menu of Napari:

```
Plugins > Napari Select Foreground > Select foreground
```

### Segment an image loaded into Napari

Select your image in the `Image` dropdown and press `Run`. The output segmentation appears in the `Labels` layer selected in the `Mask` field (if no layer is selected, a new one is created).

### Segment individual objects using bounding boxes

- Click on the `Add` button next to the `ROI` field. This adds a `Shapes layer` to the viewer.
- Click and drag bounding boxes around objects in the image. Each time you draw a bounding box a segmentation is generated in the region selected.

![screenshot](./assets/screenshot.gif)

You can choose to auto-increment the label index to distinguish individual objects. Deselect that option to annotate a single foreground class.

## Running the segmentation via a web API

You can run the `rembg` segmentation via a web API running in a `docker` container.

**Advantages**
- The segmentation can be run on a remote machine with optimization (e.g. GPU).
- The segmentation models will be downloaded inside the docker container instead of the user's file system.
- You can minimally install the package with `pip install napari-rembg` on the client's machine. This will *not* install the `rembg` library, which can solve potential dependency conflicts or bugs.

**Setup**

See [these instructions](./src/rembg-api/README.md) on how to set up the docker container and web API.

**Usage**

Start `napari-rembg` from the `Plugins` menu of Napari:

```
Plugins > Napari Select Foreground > Select foreground (Web API)
```

Select regions of interest (ROIs) using napari

## Installation

You can install napari-roi via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

    pip install napari-roi

Alternatively, you can install napari-roi via [conda](https://conda.io/):

    conda install -c conda-forge napari-roi

## Usage

The *napari-roi* plugin can be opened from within napari (`napari -> napari-roi: regions of interest`) and operates on napari *Shapes* layers.

ROIs can be added to any napari *Shapes* layer, either by drawing a standard napari shape (e.g. rectangle), or by adding a rectangular ROI of specified size using the `Add ROI` functionality in the *napari-roi* widget. Each ROI is associated with a name, a position (X/Y origin), and a size (width/height). The location of the X/Y origin of all ROIs can be chosen in the *napari-roi* widget. Note that any shape supported by napari (e.g. ellipse, rectangle, polygon, line, path) can serve as an ROI; for non-rectangular shapes, *napari-roi* computes rectangular bounding boxes aligned with the napari coordinate system to determine their positions and sizes. ROIs can be edited or deleted by modifying the corresponding shapes in napari, or by editing the corresponding row in the *napari-roi* widget.

All ROIs in the current *Shapes* layer can be saved to a comma-separated values (CSV) file using the `Save` functionality in the *napari-roi* widget. When the `Autosave` option is checked, the file is automatically updated on every ROI change. Note that the selected file is specific to the current *Shapes* layer; ROIs from different *Shapes* layers cannot be saved to the same file. ROIs can be loaded from a previously saved file and added to the current *Shapes* layer by opening the file in the *napari-roi* widget.

CSV files saved using *napari-roi* adhere to the following format:

| Columns | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Name` | ROI name |
| `X`, `Y` | Position (X/Y origin) |
| `W`, `H` | Size (width/height) |

A Napari plugin for the registration of regions of interests (ROI) in a time lapse acquistion and processing of the intensity of the registered data.

The ROI are defined using a Labels layer. Registration of multiple ROIs is supported.  

The `Registration` widget uses the user-defined labels, constructs a rectangular ROI around each of them and registers the ROIs in each time frame.

The `Processing` widget measures the ROI displacements and extracts the average intensity of the ROI, calculated on the area of the labels.

The `Subtract background` widget subtracts a background on each frame, calculated as the mean intensity on a Labels layer.
Tipically useful when ambient light affects the measurement.

## Installation

You can install `napari-roi-registration` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-roi-registration



To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/GiorgiaTortora/napari-roi-registration.git

## Usage

A detailed guide which shows how to use the widgets of the napari-roi-registration plugin and how to properly choose the parameters can be found [here]. A demo video is available at this [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXyAqZdFrSE). [Sample datasets](https://polimi365-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/10853110_polimi_it/ErHvu3QXhktGq-NLqFdZXMYBWXaRNIZWlQhWg5EdOgbmWg?e=HeExQl) are available.

### Registration Widget

1. Create a new Labels layer and draw one or more labels where you want to select a ROI (Region Of Interest). Each color in the same Labels layer represents a different label which will correspond to a different ROI.

![raw](https://github.com/GiorgiaTortora/napari-roi-registration/raw/main/images/Picture1.png)

2. Push the `Register ROIs` button: registration of the entire stack will be performed. When the registration is finished two new layers will appear in the viewer. One layer contains the centroids of the drawn labels while the other contains the bounding boxes enclosing the ROIs.
The registration starts from the currently selected frame. If `register entire stack` is selected, the registration will create a new layer for each label, with the registered ROI stacks.

![raw](https://github.com/GiorgiaTortora/napari-roi-registration/raw/main/images/Picture2.png)

### Processing Widget

Pushing the `Process registered ROIs` button, the registered ROIs will be analyzed. The intensity of the registered ROIs (measured on the area of the selected label) and the displacement of the ROIs will be calculated.
If `plot results` is selected the plot of displacement vs time index and mean intensity vs time index will appear in the Console.
Choosing the `save results` option, an excel file containing ROIs positions, displacements and intensities, will be saved. 

![raw](https://github.com/GiorgiaTortora/napari-roi-registration/raw/main/images/Picture3.png)

### Background Widget

1. Create a new Labels layer and draw a label on the area where you want to calculate the background. 

![raw](https://github.com/GiorgiaTortora/napari-roi-registration/raw/main/images/Picture4.png)

2. Push the `Subtract background` button. A new image layer will appear in the viewer. This layer contains the image to which the background was subtracted.

Widgets and type annotations for storing function results of any types.

## `Stored` type

Type `Stored[T]` is equivalent to `T` for the type checker, but `magicgui` is aware of this annotation and behaves as a ""storage"" for the `T` instances.

```python
from pathlib import Path
import pandas as pd
from magicgui import magicgui
from napari_result_stack import Stored

# Returned values will be stored in a result stack.
@magicgui
def provide_data(path: Path) -> Stored[pd.DataFrame]:
    return pd.read_csv(path)

# You can choose one of the values stored in the result stack
# for the argument `df` from a ComboBox widget.
@magicgui
def print_data(df: Stored[pd.DataFrame]):
    print(df)
```

![](https://github.com/hanjinliu/napari-result-stack/blob/main/images/demo-0.gif)

- Different types use different storage. e.g. `Stored[int]` and `Stored[str]` do not share the same place.
- Even for the same type, you can specify the second key to split the storage. e.g. `Stored[int]`, `Stored[int, 0]` and `Stored[int, ""my-plugin-name""]` use the distinct storages.

## Manually store variables

`Stored.valuesof[T]` is a `list`-like object that returns a view of the values stored in `Stored[T]`. This value view is useful if you want to store values outside `@magicgui`.

```python
from magicgui.widgets import PushButton
from datetime import datetime
from napari_result_stack import Stored

button = PushButton(text=""Click!"")

@button.changed.connect
def _record_now():
    Stored.valuesof[datetime].append(datetime.now())

```

## Result stack widget

`napari-result-stack` provides a plugin widget that is helpful to inspect all the stored values.

A plugin for interactive 3D (volumetric or time-lapse) segmentation using Meta's Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2).

Designed for bioimaging researchers working with 3D volumetric or time-lapse images, this plugin supports TIFF files in ZYX or TYX format. Users can provide input and make corrections through point clicks or manually drawn masks.

The tool leverages the [SAM2Long](https://github.com/Mark12Ding/SAM2Long) model, an optimized version of [Meta's SAM 2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2) with enhancements to the memory module for improved performance on long videos. It was built to support long videos, but it remains effective for shorter videos as well.

This [napari] plugin was generated with [copier] using the [napari-plugin-template].

## Usage

### Segmenting & tracking first object
1. **Open a 3D tiff** in napari, make sure it's in TYX or ZYX format.
2. **Select** the image in the ***Input*** dropdown.
3. **Add a new [labels layer](https://napari.org/0.5.0/howtos/layers/labels.html)** *after* the input image, then select it in the *Labels* dropdown.

    The labels layer must be added after the image to ensure dimension alignment.
4. **Select the *Model***.
5. **Click *Initialize*** to load the image and initialize the inference state.
6. **Define the initial object mask** on any frame:
    - Use the mouse middle-click to prompt the model:
        - *Middle-click* = add region
        - *Ctrl + middle-click* = remove region
    - Or use napari's built-in tools (paintbrush, eraser, etc.) to draw the mask manually.

    If the model doesn’t segment the object accurately with point prompts, manual correction using napari tools can be useful.

7. Once satisfied with the initial mask, **click *Propagate from current frame*** to obtain segmentations for all subsequent frames. The result will be added to the labels layer.

    Propagation only affects future frames. It does not recompute previous ones or consider prompts from other frames. Only the current mask is used to propagate forward.

### Making corrections
8. To refine segmentation, add/remove regions use:
    - *(Ctrl+) middle-click* prompts
    - napari’s label tools
9. *Propagate from current frame* to re-run the model's predictions with the new mask.

    The plugin treats this as a new initial mask and discards earlier prompts on that frame.

### Segmenting another object in the same image/video
10. Save the current labels layer (to preserve previous segmentation).
11. Click *Reset*, or add a new labels layer and select it in the *Labels* dropdown.
Then repeat steps from Step 6 for the next object.

###  Segment new image/video
12. *Reset* inference state.
13. Load new image and follow instructions starting from Step 1.
    *Initialize* is necessary to load the new image.

Segment anything with our **Napari** integration of Meta AI's new **Segment Anything Model (SAM)**!

SAM is the new segmentation system from Meta AI capable of **one-click segmentation of any object**, and now, our plugin neatly integrates this into Napari.

We have already **extended** SAM's click-based foreground separation to full **click-based semantic segmentation and instance segmentation**!

At last, our SAM integration supports both **2D and 3D images**!

----------------------------------

Everything mode             |  Click-based semantic segmentation mode |  Click-based instance segmentation mode

----------------------------------

## Installation

The plugin requires `python>=3.8`, as well as `pytorch>=1.7` and `torchvision>=0.8`. Please follow the instructions here to install both PyTorch and TorchVision dependencies. Installing both PyTorch and TorchVision with CUDA support is strongly recommended.

Install Napari via [pip]:
    
    pip install napari[all]

You can install `napari-sam` via [pip]:

    pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git
    pip install napari-sam



To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/napari-sam.git

## Usage

Start Napari from the console with:

    napari

Then navigate to `Plugins -> Segment Anything (napari-sam)` and drag & drop an image into Napari. At last create, a labels layer that will be used for the SAM predictions, by clicking in the layer list on the third button.

You can then auto-download one of the available SAM models (this can take 1-2 minutes),  activate one of the annotations & segmentation modes, and you are ready to go!

### napari plugin for instance and semantic segmentation annotation using Segment Anything Model (SAM)

This is a plugin for [napari](https://napari.org/), a multi-dimensional image viewer for Python, that allows for instance and semantic segmentation annotation. This plugin provides an easy-to-use interface for annotating images with the option to output annotations as COCO format.

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:

## Installation

### Step 1: Install napari-SAM4IS

You can install `napari-SAM4IS` via [pip]:

```bash
pip install napari-SAM4IS
```

Or via conda

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge napari-SAM4IS
```


### Step 2: Install Segment Anything Model

**IMPORTANT**: You must install the Segment Anything Model separately to use this plugin:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git
```

### Development Installation

To install the latest development version:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git
```

Or you can install from source by cloning the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git
cd segment-anything
pip install -e .
```

For more detailed instructions, please refer to the [SAM installation guide](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything#installation).

### napari-SAM4IS Installation

You can install `napari-SAM4IS` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-SAM4IS


Or via conda

    conda install -c conda-forge napari-SAM4IS



To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/hiroalchem/napari-SAM4IS.git

## Usage
### Preparation
1. Open an image in napari and launch the plugin. (Opening an image after launching the plugin is also possible.)
2. Upon launching the plugin, three layers will be automatically created: SAM-Box, SAM-Predict, and Accepted. The usage of these layers will be explained later.
3. In the widget that appears, select the model you want to use and click the load button. (The default option is recommended.)
4. Next, select the image layer you want to annotate.
5. Then, select whether you want to do instance segmentation or semantic segmentation. (Note that for 3D images, semantic segmentation should be chosen in the current version.)
6. Finally, select the output layer as ""shapes"" for instance segmentation or ""labels"" for semantic segmentation. (For instance segmentation, the ""Accept"" layer can also be used.)

### Annotation
1. Select the SAM-Box layer and use the rectangle tool to enclose the object you want to segment.
2. An automatic segmentation mask will be created and output to the SAM-Predict layer.
3. If you want to make adjustments, do so in the SAM-Predict layer.
4. To accept or reject the annotation, press ""a"" or ""r"" on the keyboard, respectively.
5. If you accept the annotation, it will be output as label 1 for semantic segmentation or converted to a polygon and output to the designated layer for instance segmentation.
6. If you reject the annotation, the segmentation mask in the SAM-Predict layer will be discarded.
7. After accepting or rejecting the annotation, the SAM-Predict layer will automatically reset to blank and return to the SAM-Box layer.

### Saving
1. If you have output to the labels layer, use napari's standard functionality to save the mask.
2. If you have output to the shapes layer, you can save the shapes layer using napari's standard functionality, or you can click the ""save"" button to output a JSON file in COCO format for each image in the folder. (The JSON file will have the same name as the image.)

A plugin to visualise 3D spatial single cell omics

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

## Test and atlas datasets

Because the datasets representing the mouse embryo at stages E8.5 and E9.0 are rather large, it is not possible to host them on GitHub. They are instead hosted on figshare at the following links:

- [E8.5 replicate 1](https://figshare.com/s/1c29d867bc8b90d754d2)
- [E8.5 replicate 2](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21695849.v1)
- [E9.0 replicate 1](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21695879.v1)

Once downloaded, one can open them in the viewer as explained below (note that the files for the tissue names are stored in the json file there: `napari-sc3D-viewer/test_data/corresptissues.json`). It can be downloaded by right-clicking on the following [link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuignardLab/napari-sc3D-viewer/main/test_data/corresptissues.json) and then clicking on ""Save link as"".

## Installation

----------------------------------

__Disclaimer:__
While we tried to make the installation and usage as easy as possible, please keep in mind that [napari-sc3d-viewer] is still under development, it has been and is being developed by a single person. We will be happy to answer any question and help in any way.

There are many ways to install our viewer, but the global idea is that it works in two steps:

- first installing [napari]
- then installing the [napari-sc3d-viewer] plugin.

Installing [napari] and the [napari-sc3d-viewer] plugin can be done either through command line or using an interface.

If you have decided to use command line, as [napari] developers do, we strongly recommend to install the viewer in an environement such as a conda environment `conda` for example:

```shell
conda create -n sc3D python=3.10
conda activate sc3D
```

### Installing napari

The first step is to [install napari](https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/fundamentals/installation.html) on your computer. The previous link should explain how to do so. There you can find either the installation via terminal or directly by [downloading the binary](https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/fundamentals/installation.html#install-as-a-bundled-app).

#### Quick trouble shooting

Installing [napari] can sometimes be difficult. If you try to install [napari] via the command line and it gets stuck ""resolving the environment"" you can try to install it the following way:

```shell
conda create -n sc3D python=3.10
conda activate sc3D
conda install pyqt pip
pip install napari
```

### Installing napari-sc3D-viewer

Once [napari] is installed, you can install `napari-sc3D-viewer`.
As for [napari], [napari-sc3D-viewer] can be installed either through an interface or via the terminal.

#### Installation via graphical interface

To install [napari-sc3D-viewer] with a visual interface, you should use the [napari's plugin manager](https://napari.org/stable/plugins/find_and_install_plugin.html) look for the plugin there and install it as explained in the previous link.

#### Installation via the terminal

Another way is to install `napari-sc3D-viewer` via [pip] or via [conda]:

```shell
conda install napari-sc3d-viewer
```

or

```shell
pip install napari-sc3d-viewer
```

Finally, to install latest development version :

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/GuignardLab/napari-sc3D-viewer.git
```

#### Installation of the surface computation module

To install the surface computation enabled version it is necessary to use Python 3.9 (until [VTK] is ported to Python 3.10) and you can run one of the following commands:

```shell
pip install '.[pyvista]'
```

from the correct folder or

```shell
pip install 'napari-sc3D-viewer[pyvista]'
```

or

```shell
conda install 'napari-sc3D-viewer[pyvista]'
```

to install directly from pip or

```shell
pip install 'napari-sc3D-viewer[pyvista] @ git+https://github.com/GuignardLab/napari-sc3D-viewer.git'
```

to install the latest version

## Usage

`napari-sc3D-viewer` allows users to easily visualise and navigate 3D spatial single-cell transcriptomics using napari.

### Starting the plugin

First, you need to start [napari], for example, one can start it from a terminal just by typing:

```shell
napari
```

in the correct environment.

Then, one can follow the following steps to browse the dataset.

To open the plugin you can click on the ""Load spatial single cell"" from the `Plugins -> napari-sc3d-viewer` menu:
![loading image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuignardLab/napari-sc3D-viewer/main/images/0.openplugin.png)

Once opened you should have an interface poping similar to the one showed in the image below (note that it might not be exactly the same depending on the version of the viewer you are using).

### Loading and opening a dataset

The expected dataset is a [scanpy]/[anndata] h5ad file together with an optional json file that maps cluster id numbers to actual tissue/cluster name.

The json file should look like that:

```json
{
    ""1"": ""Endoderm"",
    ""2"": ""Heart"",
    ""10"": ""Anterior neuroectoderm""
}
```

If no json file or a wrong json file is given, the original cluster id numbers are used.

The h5ad file should be informed in (1) and the json file in (2).
![loading image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuignardLab/napari-sc3D-viewer/main/images/1.loading.png)

Let `data` be your h5ad data structure. To work properly, the viewer is expecting 4 different columns to be present in the h5ad file:

- the cluster id column (by default named 'predicted.id' that can be accessed as `data.obs['predicted.id']`)
- the 3D position column (by default named 'X_spatial_registered' that can be accessed as `data.obsm['X_spatial_registered']`)
- the gene names if not already in the column name (by default named 'feature_name' that can be accessed as `data.var['feature_name']`)
- umap coordinates (by default named 'X_umap' that can be accessed as `data.obsm['X_umap']`)

If the default column names are not consistent with your dataset, they can be changed in the tab `Parameters` (3) next to the tab `Loading files`

Once all the data paths and fields are correctly informed pressing the `Load Atlas` button (4) will load the dataset.

### Exploring a dataset

Once the dataset is loaded there are few options to explore it.

The viewer should look like to the following:
![viewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuignardLab/napari-sc3D-viewer/main/images/2.viewer.png)

It is divided in two main parts, the Tissue visualisation (1) part and the Metric visualisation (2) one.
Both of them are themselves split in two and three tabs respectively. All these tabs allow you to visualise and explore the dataset in different fashions.

The Tissues tab (1.1) allows to select the tissues to display, to show the legend and to colour the cells according to their tissue types.

The Surfaces tab (1.2) allows to construct coarse surfaces of tissues and to display them.

The Single metric tab (2.1) allows to display a metric, whether it is a gene intensity or a numerical metric that is embedded in the visualised dataset. This tab also allows to threshold cells according to the viewed metric, to change the contrast and the colour map.

The 2 Genes (2.2) tab allows to display gene coexpression.

The umap tab (2.3) allows to display the umap of the selected cells and to manually select subcategories of cells to be displayed.

![viewer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/GuignardLab/napari-sc3D-viewer/main/images/3.description.png)

#### Explanatory ""videos""

The plugin is meant to be easy to use. That means that you should be able to play with it and figure things out by yourself.

That being said, it is not always that easy. You can find below a series of videos showing how to perform some of the main features.

#### Loading data

This napari plugin is designed to hpyerspectral images of sediment cores. It is composed of three interfaces allowing the user to:

- import HDR images
- normalize the images using white and dark references
- mask unwanted regions
- perform spectral dimensionality reduction via minimum noise fraction analysis
- perform spatial dimensionality reduction based on pixel purity indices
- identify representative end-members by clustering pure pixels
- select relevant regions in spectra to compute absorption indices and create absorption maps 

### Pre-processing: Sediment widget

The sediment widget allows the user to import an HDR image and to normalize it using white and dark references. The widget also allows the user to mask unwanted regions of the images.

## Documentation

You can find a detailed documentation [here](https://guiwitz.github.io/napari-sediment).
## Installation

Create a conda environment and activate it. We highly recommend to use the new conda version called mamba to speed up the installation process. You can install it from [here](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge). If you don't use mamba, replace the mamba command by conda in the following instructions:

    mamba create -n sediment python=3.9 napari pyqt -c conda-forge
    mamba activate sediment

Then you can install `napari-sediment` use:

    pip install git+https://github.com/guiwitz/napari-sediment.git

A python script editor for napari based on [haesleinhuepf's fork of PyQode](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/pyqode.core).

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using with [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

![](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-script-editor/raw/main/docs/screenshot2.png)

## Usage

Start the script editor from the menu `Tools > Scripts > Script Editor`. Use the auto-completion while typing, 
check out the [napari tutorials](https://napari.org/tutorials/) and the
[example scripts](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-script-editor/tree/main/example_scripts). 
Use the `Run` button to execute a script.

![](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-script-editor/raw/main/docs/type_and_run_screencast.gif)

If you save the script to the folder "".napari-scripts"" in your home directory, you will find the script in the 
`Tools > Scripts` menu in napari. You can then also start it from there.

![](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-script-editor/raw/main/docs/run_from_menu_screencast.gif)

Note: If you have scripts, that might be useful to others, please send them as 
[pull-request](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-script-editor/pulls) to the examples in 
repository or share them in any other way that suits you.

### chatGPT support

In case [openAI API](https://openai.com/blog/openai-api) is installed, you find another button in the script editor to `Ask chatGPT`. 
Enter a prompt in the script editor and click the button. The script editor will send the prompt to
chatGPT and replace it with the answer. For example try entering:
```python
Write Python code for segmenting an image using these steps:
    * Apply a Gaussian blur
    * Threshold the image using Otsu's method
    * Apply connected component labeling
```
and it will replace it with code accordingly. If it doesn't work in the first attempt, try again. ChatGPT's answers are not always the same.

![](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-script-editor/raw/main/docs/ask_chatgpt.gif)


## Installation
* Get a python environment, e.g. via [mini-conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).

A simple plugin for 2D medical image segmentation. In this project, we are trying to use Flood method for segmentation. 
Flood segmentation, also known as flood fill or region growing, is an image segmentation technique that starts from a seed point and expands to neighboring pixels with similar properties (e.g., intensity, color). In our project, you only can segment one label at the time. Below is a description of the repository's structure and the purpose of each file:

PARSEG (PAralellised Refinement of SEGmentations) combines segmentation masks and filters overlapping objects based on colocalization statistics, such as percent overlap. 

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

## Overview
By leveraging [Dask], PARSEG filters overlapping segmentations masks in a computationally efficient manner by processing individual 2D slices in parallel. 

There are two different ways to interact with PARSEG and use it for different objectives:

* As a napari plugin for graphical user interaction
* As a Python API to allow users to integrate PARSEG tools into their own custom workflows

## Installation

You can install `napari-segmentation-overlap-filter` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-segmentation-overlap-filter

## Getting Started

### Napari Plugin
1. Download the example dataset images
2. Start napari and open both images as separate layers
3. Convert the layers from an `Image Layer` to a `Labels Layer` by right-clicking on the layer
4. Open the plugin with `Plugins > Segmentation Overlap Filter` and the widget will appear on the right
5. Select the two segmentation masks you'd like to combine using the drop down and menu
6. Drag the slider to set percent overlap allowed
7. Click `Run`
8. Optionally, export the overlap dataframe as a csv file

### Python API
This [example notebook] shows how you can integrate the Python API into your own workflow for filtering and combining overlapping segmentation masks

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

## Installation

You can install `napari-segment-anything` via [pip]:

```bash
pip install napari-segment-anything
```

We recommend installing the latest development version because this package is being developed:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/jookuma/napari-segment-anything.git
```

**IMPORTANT**: `napari` won't work if you don't have `pyqt5` or `pyside2` installed.

## Instructions

### Opening napari-segment-anything

This software is napari plugin, so once you have napari installed you can open it using the command line:

```bash
napari <your image path> -w napari-segment-anything 'Segment Anything'
```

I noticed that sometimes napari fails to load the plugin widget from the command line, go to step 2 from below to load it.

If you prefer the user interface you need to:

1) Drag and drop your image into napari to load it;
2) Go to the ""Plugins"" file menu in the upper right corner and select the ""Segment Anything"" plugin.
3) Follow the instructions below for usage.

**IMPORTANT**: If you get an error make sure you have `pyqt5` or `pyside2` installed.

### Usage

- Interactions are done on the ""SAM points"" and ""SAM box"" layers using the existing functionalities of napari. Only rectangle shapes trigger the network prediction.
- For points supervision, left clicks are positive cues (object) and right clicks are negative (background).
- Press the ""Confirm Annot."" button (or the ""C"" key) to propagate the current segmentation mask to the label image.
- Use the napari labels layer features to delete or edit already confirmed labels.

## Installation

```pip install napari-segment```

or

From napari plugin

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11408456/201949692-33f94eaf-ac43-44dd-8c21-e9f9a460c5b2.png)


## Usage for segmentation

1. Drag your nd2 file into napari (otherwise try the Sample data from File / Open Sample / napari-segment)
2. Lauch Plugins -> napari-segment: Segment multipos
3. Select the brightfield channel
4. The data is lazily loaded from nd2 dataset and dynamically segmented in the viewer.
5. Binning 1-8 allows to skip small features and focus on bigger objects, also makes processing faster.
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11408456/201701163-70c4af51-8a3a-42a0-adb9-32f0114eb49d.png)
6. Various preprocessing modes allow segmentation of different objects:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11408456/201701809-f16a23ea-d14a-4b38-8b8c-08a113416509.png)

  - Invert: will use the dark shadow around aggregate - best for very old aggregates , out of focus (File / Open Sample / napari-segment / Old aggregate)
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11408456/201701950-efd86fae-d85b-471c-bb44-a0e328e26adc.png)

  - Gradient: best for very sharp edges, early aggregates, single cells (File / Open Sample / napari-segment / Early aggregate) 
  
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11408456/201705697-5d0d0643-44b6-4cb9-9208-4a29dd899d8c.png)
  
  
  - Gauss diff: Fluorescence images
  The result of preprocessing will be shown in the ""Preprocessing"" layer.
7. Smooth, Theshold and Erode parameters allow you to adjust the preliminary segmentation -> they all will appear in the ""Detections"" layer as outlines 

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11408456/201703675-cff6bac1-bb2a-4d45-963f-6e6d00309c77.png)

8. Min/max diameter and eccentricity allow you to filter out unwanted regions -> the good regions will appear in the ""selected labels"" layer as filled areas.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11408456/201703754-2c83a8d6-70c2-444a-8e30-54a39c901cd0.png)

9. Once satisfied, click ""Save the params!"" - it will automatically create file.nd2.params.yml file, so you can recall how the segmentation was done. Next time you open the same dataset, the parameters will be loaded automatically from this file. 

10. Next section is for quantifying the sizes. Pixel size will be retrieved automatically from metadata. If not: update it manually and click Update plots to see the correct sizes. Click on any suspected value to see the corresponding frame and try to adjust the above parameters. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/11408456/201704881-b2303b9a-50c6-49c7-80ff-a6099cc2a151.png)

11. If impossible to get good results with automatic pipeline, click Clone for manual correction: this will create an editable ""Manual"" layer which you can edin with built-in tools in napari. Click ""Update plots"" to see the updated values. 

12. ""Save csv!"" will generate a csv file with regionprops.

A Napari SAM plugin to segment everything in your image (not just some things)

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:

## Instructions

### 0. Select recipe (implementation)

Use the 'select recipe' combo box to choose the implementation.   Currently 'Mobile SAM v2', 'Mobile SAM finetuned' and 'SAM Automatic Mask Generator' are available.  Not that the sub-options will change slightly depending on which recipe you choose.  'Mobile SAM v2' and 'Mobile SAM finetuned' (finetuned using Cellpose training data) first use a bounding box detector to locate objects then feed the bounding boxes to SAM.  'SAM Automatic Mask Generator' uses a grid of points as the prompt for SAM.  Our experiments indicate that the 'Mobile SAM' recipes work well in most cases.  'SAM Automatic Mask Generator' may be useful for cases where bounding box detection was sub-optimal.  

### 1. Generate 3D labels

In the first step adjust SAM settings and generate a 3D representation of your labels.  The 3D view is needed to represent overlapping labels (labels that overlap in xy can be represented at different z).  After tweaking settings press 'Generate 3D labels'.  Be patient.  SAM with permissive settings can potentially find thousands of labels in a complicated image.  At least 6G of GPU memory is recommended to run SAM and to render to 3D label map (which can be large). 

### 2. Filter 3D labels

In the next step select a stat (solidity, hue, IOE, stability and other stats are available) then use the sliders and number boxes to filter out labels that do not represent structure of interest.  If you double click on a label a popup will appear containing the stats for that label.  Inpect stats for labels you want to keep, and labels you want to eliminate to help determine the filter settings. 

### 3. Generate 2D labels

In this step the 3D labels are projected to a 2D label map, use the dropdown to choose between projecting big labels in front or small labels in front.

## Usage

1. Run `membrain-seg` with the `--store-connected-components` flag (optional, otherwise connected components will be calculated while opening)
2. Open the segmentation in Napari, find out which component numbers correspond to your feature.
    ![Label Layer](images/image2.png)
3. Enter these numbers and a feature name in the widget, press run. 
    ![Widget](images/image3.png)
4. Save the resulting layer using naparis built-in dialog. 
5. Now you have a standalone binary segmentation of your feature of interest.

This napari-plugin is based on scikit-image and allows segmenting nuclei and cells based on fluorescence microscopy images with high intensity in nuclei and/or membranes.

## Usage

This plugin populates image processing operations to the `Tools` menu in napari.
You can recognize them with their suffix `(nsbatwm)` in brackets.
Furthermore, it can be used from the [napari-assistant](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-assistant) graphical user interface. 
Therefore, just click the menu `Tools > Utilities > Assistant (na)` or run `naparia` from the command line.

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-segment-blobs-and-things-with-membranes/raw/main/docs/tools_menu_screenshot.png)

You can also call these functions as shown in [the demo notebook](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-segment-blobs-and-things-with-membranes/blob/main/docs/demo.ipynb).

### Voronoi-Otsu-Labeling

This algorithm uses [Otsu's thresholding method](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4310076) in combination with 
[Gaussian blur](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.filters.html#skimage.filters.gaussian) and a 
[Voronoi-Tesselation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voronoi_diagram) 
approach to label bright objects such as nuclei in an intensity image. The alogrithm has two sigma parameters which allow
you to fine-tune where objects should be cut (`spot_sigma`) and how smooth outlines should be (`outline_sigma`).
This implementation aims to be similar to [Voronoi-Otsu-Labeling in clesperanto](https://github.com/clEsperanto/pyclesperanto_prototype/blob/master/demo/segmentation/voronoi_otsu_labeling.ipynb).

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-segment-blobs-and-things-with-membranes/raw/main/docs/voronoi_otsu_labeling.png)

### Seeded Watershed

Starting from an image showing high-intensity membranes and a seed-image where objects have been labeled (e.g. using Voronoi-Otsu-Labeling),
objects are labeled that are constrained by the membranes.

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-segment-blobs-and-things-with-membranes/raw/main/docs/seeded_watershed.png)

### Seeded Watershed with mask

If there is additionally a mask image available, one can use the `Seeded Watershed with mask`, to constraint the flooding 
on a membrane image (1), starting from nuclei (2), limited by a mask image (3) to produce a cell segmentation within the mask (4).

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-segment-blobs-and-things-with-membranes/raw/main/docs/seeded_watershed_with_mask.png)

### Seeded Watershed using local minima as starting points

Similar to the Seeded Watershed and Voronoi-Otsu-Labeling explained above, you can use this tool to segment an image
showing membranes without an additional image showing nuclei. The two sigma parameters allow to fine tune how close 
objects can be and how precise their boundaries are detected.

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-segment-blobs-and-things-with-membranes/raw/main/docs/local_minima_seeded_watershed.png)

### Gaussian blur

Applies a [Gaussian blur](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.filters.html#skimage.filters.gaussian) to an
image. This might be useful for denoising, e.g. before applying the Threshold-Otsu method.

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-segment-blobs-and-things-with-membranes/raw/main/docs/gaussian_blur.png)

### Subtract background

Subtracts background using [scikit-image's rolling-ball algorithm](https://scikit-image.org/docs/stable/auto_examples/segmentation/plot_rolling_ball.html). 
This might be useful, for example to make intensity of membranes more similar in different regions of an image.

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-segment-blobs-and-things-with-membranes/raw/main/docs/subtract_background.png)

### Threshold Otsu

Binarizes an image using [scikit-image's threshold Otsu algorithm](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/segmentation/plot_thresholding.html), also known as 
[Otsu's method](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4310076).

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-segment-blobs-and-things-with-membranes/raw/main/docs/threshold_otsu.png)

### Split touching objects (formerly known as binary watershed).

In case objects stick together after thresholding, this tool might help.
It aims to deliver similar results as [ImageJ's watershed implementation](https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/docs/menus/process.html#watershed).

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-segment-blobs-and-things-with-membranes/raw/main/docs/binary_watershed.png)

### Connected component labeling

Takes a binary image and produces a label image with all separated objects labeled differently. Under the hood, it uses
[scikit-image's label function](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/segmentation/plot_label.html).

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-segment-blobs-and-things-with-membranes/raw/main/docs/connected_component_labeling.png)

### Manual split and merge labels

Split and merge labels in napari manually via the `Tools > Utilities menu`:

Analyze shapes of meshes: This plugin provides advanced measures of shape for meshes. It is based largely on the following libraries and tools:

* [PyFM](https:/github.com/robinmagnet/pyfm)
* [boundary-first-flattening](https://github.com/GeometryCollective/boundary-first-flattening)

## Shape analysis

This plugin provides Laplace spectra ([Reuter, Wolter, Peinecke (2005)](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1060244.1060256)), heat kernel signatures ([Bronstein & Kokkinos (2010)](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5539838/)) & wave kernel signatures ([Audrey, Schlickewei, Cremers et al.](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6130444)).

**Laplace spectra** can be imagined to be the equivalent of resonance modes on the surface of a mesh. The resonance and the resonance modes can, for typical objects, look like this:

![](https://github.com/jo-mueller/napari-shape-odyssey/raw/main/docs/imgs/Eigenvalues.gif)

**Heat kernel signatures**: Heat dissipation on a mesh depends on local geometry. You can use the heat kernel signature to easily generate a large number of local features of shape

![](https://github.com/jo-mueller/napari-shape-odyssey/raw/main/docs/imgs/heat_kernel_signature.gif)

## Unwrapping

This plugin provides a number of methods to unwrap a mesh into basic shapes such as spheres or disks. The method relies on [boundary-first flattening](https://github.com/GeometryCollective/boundary-first-flattening) - currently it's only available on Windows.

This napari plugin allows you to segment single images or series of images using built-in or custom Cellpose models as well as to analyze the properties of these segmented regions (""region properties""). Properties can be visualized for a single image or a complete experiment in the form of histograms that can also be filtered (e.g. based on area size, mean intensity etc.) Thanks to the [napari-skimage-regionprops](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-skimage-regionprops) plugin, properties of segmented objects can be interactively explored at a single object level.

## Main goal

The main goal of this plugin is to simplify the classical image processing pipeline of image segmentation followed by region analysis via Cellpose. It allows to quickly get a quantification of a set of images without the need for any scripting.

## Installation

In order to use this plugin, whe highly recommend to create a specific environment and to install the required software in it. You can create a conda environment using:

    conda create -n serialcellpose python=3.8.5 napari -c conda-forge

Then activate it and install the plugin:
    
    conda activate serialcellpose
    pip install napari-serialcellpose

### Potential issue with PyTorch

Cellpose and therefore the plugin and napari can crash without warning in some cases with ```torch==1.12.0```. This can be fixed by reverting to an earlier version using:
    
    pip install torch==1.11.0

### GPU

In order to use a GPU:

1. Uninstall the PyTorch version that gets installed by default with Cellpose:

        pip uninstall torch

2. Make sure your have up-to-date drivers for your NVIDIA card installed.

3. Re-install a GPU version of PyTorch via conda using a command that you can find [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) (this takes care of the cuda toolkit, cudnn etc. so **no need to install manually anything more than the driver**). The command will look like this:

        conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch

### Plugin Updates

To update the plugin, you only need to activate the existing environment and install the new version:

    conda activate serialcellpose
    pip install napari-serialcellpose -U

## Usage: segmentation

The main interface is shown below. The sequence of events should be the following:

1. Select a folder containing images. The list of files within that folder will appear in the area above. You can also just drag and drop a folder or an image in that area. When selecting an image, it gets displayed in the viewer. Images are opened via [aicsimageio](https://allencellmodeling.github.io/aicsimageio/). You can use grayscale images, RGB images or multi-channel images. In the latter case, **make sure each channel opens as a separate layer when you open them using the napari-aicsimagio importer**.
2. If you want to save the segmentation and tables with properties, select a folder that will contain the output.
3. Select the type of cellpose model.
4. If you use a custom model, select its location.
5. Run the analysis on the currently selected image or on all files in the folder.
### Options

6. Select if you want to use a GPU or not.
7. If you are using multi-channel images, you can specify which channel to segment and optionally which to use as ""nuclei"" channel to help cell segmentation.
8. In case you are using one of the built-in models, you can set the estimated diameter of your objects.
9. In the Options tab you will find a few more options for segmentation, including the two thresholds ```flow_threshold``` and ```cellprob_threshold```. You can also decide to discard objects touching the border. Using the ```Select options yml file``` you can select a ```.yml``` file which contains a list of additional options to pass to the ```eval``` method of the Cellpose model. **Note that options specified in the yml file will override options set in the GUI**. The file [my_options.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/guiwitz/napari-serialcellpose/main/src/napari_serialcellpose/_tests/my_options.yml) is an example of such a file where for example the ```diameter``` (also available in the GUI) and ```resample``` (not available in the GUI) options are set. 

<img src=""https://github.com/guiwitz/napari-serialcellpose/raw/main/illustrations/napari_serialcellpose_gui1.png"" alt=""image"" width=""500"">
<img src=""https://github.com/guiwitz/napari-serialcellpose/raw/main/illustrations/napari_serialcellpose_gui1b.png"" alt=""image"" width=""500"">

### Properties

10. After segmentation, properties of the objects can automatically be computed. You can select which properties should be computed in the Options tab. As defined in ```napari-skimage-regionprops``` properties are grouped by types. If you want to measure intensity properties such as mean intensity, you have to specify which channel (```Analysis channel```) you want to perform the measurement on.

### Output

The results of the analysis are saved in the folder chosen in #2. The segmentation mask is saved with the same name as the original image with the suffix ```_mask.tif```. A table with properties is saved in the subfolder ```tables``` also with the same name as the image with the suffix ```props.csv```. If you run the plugin on multiple files in a folder, a ```summary.csv``` file is also generated which compiles all the data.
## Usage: post-processing

After the analysis is done, when you select an image, the corresponding segmentation mask is shown on top of the image as shown below. This also works for saved segmentations: in that case you just select a folder with data and the corresponding output folder.

<img src=""https://github.com/guiwitz/napari-serialcellpose/raw/main/illustrations/napari_serialcellpose_gui2.png"" alt=""image"" width=""500"">

### Properties

If you head to the **Properties** tab, you will find there two histograms showing the distribution of two properties that you can choose from a list at the top of the window. Below the plot you find the table containing information for each cell (each line is a cell).

As shown below, if you select the box ```show selected```, you can select items in the properties table and it will highlight the corresponding cell in the viewer. If you select the pipet tool, you can also select a cell and see the corresponding line in the table highlighted.

<img src=""https://github.com/guiwitz/napari-serialcellpose/raw/main/illustrations/napari_serialcellpose_gui3.png"" alt=""image"" width=""500"">

### Summary

Finally if you select the **Summary** tab, and click on ```Load summary```, it will load all data of the current output folder and create histograms of two properties that can be selected. An additional property can be used for filtering the data. Using the sliders, one can set a minimum and maximum threshold on the ""filtering property"", which will create a sub-selection of the data.

Simple plugin for 2D keypoint detection and affine registration with RANSAC.

![moving image with inlier keypoints](doc/moving_keypoints.png)
![fixed image with inlier keypoints](doc/fixed_keypoints.png)

Moving and fixed images showing inlier keypoints after RANSAC


----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.
It uses the [scikit-image] SIFT keypoint detection routines to find distinctive image points and generate local descriptions of the image around them.
Correspondences between the two images are then found by looking for pairs of keypoints, one in each of the two images, with closely matching descriptors.



For typical images, many of these correspondences will be wrong. To reduce these false correspondences, the plugin applies the RANSAC algorithm. This randomly selects a small subset of the matching pairs of keypoints, estimates the affine transformation between this subset of keypoints, and then evaluates how many of the other pairs of keypoints also closely agree with this affine transformation (""inliers""). A large number of random samples are tested, and the transformation with the most inliers retained.

The plugin outputs two points layers, one for each image, containing all the corresponding (inlier) SIFT keypoints. It also uses the estimated affine transformation between the two images to deform the ""moving"" image layer onto the ""fixed"" image layer.

This approach is an attempt to provide similar functionality to the Stephan Saalfeld's Fiji ""Extract SIFT Correspondences"" plugin [extract], and more-or-less
just provides a napari interface to the existing routines in scikit-image. There are great examples in the scikit-image documentation (e.g. [SIFT-example] and [RANSAC-example]) that can be used if you would like to use these routines in your own analysis scripts.


## Installation

You can install `napari-sift-registration` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-sift-registration

To install the latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/jfozard/napari-sift-registration.git

## Usage

### Basic usage

- Load two 2D single channel images in Napari.
- Select the menu item Plugins > napari-sift-registration
- Select these two images as the ""Moving image layer"" and the ""Fixed image layer"". The moving image will be deformed by the transformation to look like the fixed image.
- The remaining parameters are the default settings from scikit-image; try these default values first.

### Advanced usage

The parameter values for SIFT feature detection, keypoint matching and RANSAC are accessible from the plugin gui. For further information about their use, see the appropriate scikit-image documentation:

Upsampling before feature detection, maximum number of octaves, maximum number of scales in every octave, blur level of seed image, feature descriptor size, feature descriptor orientation bins: see [scikit-image-SIFT].

Closest/next closest ratio: see [scikit-image-match_descriptors]

Minimum number of points sampled for each RANSAC model, distance for points to be inliers in RANSAC model, maximum number of trials in RANSAC model: see [scikit-image-RANSAC]

Only show inlier keypoints: If checked, only show corresponding keypoints that are inliers after RANSAC. If unchecked, show all corresponding keypoints.

### Limitations

Only 2D, single channel images (for now).

An interactive signal selector and annotator for napari, based on [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/stable/).

[Jump to Intallation](#installation)

----------------------------------

## Usage

This plugin opens an embedded plotter in napari capable of plotting and interacting (selecting/annotating) with individual object signals (typically temporal features).

![plotting](https://github.com/zoccoler/napari-signal-selector/raw/main/images/plotting.gif)

### Input Data

napari-signal-selector works with a [Labels layer](https://napari.org/stable/howtos/layers/labels.html) containing segmented objects and whose `features` attribute contains a table that follows the example structure shown below:

| `label` | `frame` | `feature` | ...  |
|-------|-------|---------|---|
| 1     | 0     | 1.0     | ...  |
| 2     | 0     | 1.0     | ...  |
| 3     | 0     | 0.5     | ...  |
| 4     | 0     | 0.5     | ...  |
| 1     | 1     | 2.0     | ...  |
| 2     | 1     | 1.0     | ...  |
| 3     | 1     | 1.0     | ...  |
| 4     | 1     | 1.0     | ...  |
| 1     | 2     | 3.0     | ...  |
| 2     | 2     | 1.0     | ...  |
| 3     | 2     | 0.5     | ...  |
| 4     | 2     | 1.5     | ...  |
| ⋮     | ⋮     | ⋮     |   |

Basically, it needs an object identifier (in this case, the `label` column) that matches the labels in the Labels layer, and other columns containing x- and y-axis numbers to plot. Typically, x-axis is some temporal-related property.

Here is how one could add such a layer to a napari viewer via code (check [this example notebook](./examples/synthetic_example.ipynb) for more details):

```python
viewer.add_labels(labels_image, features = table)
```

If a layer like this is selected, you can choose what to plot by means of dropdown fields in the bottom of the plotter.

Below is a basic example using the ""Flashing Polygons"" synthetic data:

![intro](https://github.com/zoccoler/napari-signal-selector/raw/main/images/intro.gif)

## Tools

### Selection Tool

The selection tool (arrowhead icon) is a toggle button which enables you to select individual signals. Once activated, the icon gets highlighted and you can click over individual signals to select them. Right-clicking unselects everything.

![select](https://github.com/zoccoler/napari-signal-selector/raw/main/images/select.gif)

If the region you want to click is too crowded, consider zooming in first and then selecting.

![zoom-select](https://github.com/zoccoler/napari-signal-selector/raw/main/images/zoom_select.gif)

And if you know which label you want to select, you can enable `'show selected'` from the Labels layer options to solely display one label at a time. The Lables layer picker tool may help you get the right label.

![show-selected](https://github.com/zoccoler/napari-signal-selector/raw/main/images/show_selected.gif)

### Annotation Tool

Once one or multiple signals are selected, you can annotate them with the annotation tool (brush with a 'plus' icon). You need to choose a signal class first.
*Remember to right-click to remove previous selections when annotating different signal classes!*

![annotation](https://github.com/zoccoler/napari-signal-selector/raw/main/images/annotation.gif)

Annotations are saved back in the table in a new column called 'Annotations'.
*Currently multiple annotations is not possible, i.e., more than one class assigned to the same part of the signal.*

### Span-Selection Tool

You can use the span-selection tool (bounded horizontal arrows icon) to sub-select one or multiple parts of signals. Right-click to unselect regions. Hold 'SHIFT' while dragging the mouse to select multiple sub-regions.

![span-select](https://github.com/zoccoler/napari-signal-selector/raw/main/images/span_select.gif)

You can use this in conjunction with the annotation tool to have sub-regions from the same signal with different annotations.

![](https://github.com/zoccoler/napari-signal-selector/raw/main/images/span_annotation.gif)

### Deletion Tool

If you made a mistake, you can remove previous annotations by selecting signal(s) and clicking on the trash icon at the right of the toolbar (or just annotate them with class 0).

![delete](https://github.com/zoccoler/napari-signal-selector/raw/main/images/delete.gif)

Also, with the selection tool enbaled, by holding 'SHIFT' and left-clicking, you can select all signals. This may be useful to delete all previous annotations.

![select-delete-all](https://github.com/zoccoler/napari-signal-selector/raw/main/images/select_delete_all.gif)

### Exporting Annotations

The table with annotations can be displayed in napari using the 'Show table' widget from [napari-skimage-regionprops plugin](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-skimage-regionprops#napari-skimage-regionprops-nsr), which is available under `Tools > Measurements > Show Table (nsr)`. This plugin may require a specific napari version, so check its documentation for more details.

![](https://github.com/zoccoler/napari-signal-selector/raw/main/images/table_view.gif)

By the way, with `'show selected'` checked, you can click on a label row in the table and see the corresponding label in the image **...and** in the plotter!

To export the table, click on `'Save as csv...'`.

Another option is to run the following code in the napari console (replace `'Labels'` with the name of your Labels layer and `'annotations.csv'` with the desired file name or file path):

```python
import pandas as pd
df = viewer.layers['Labels'].data.features
df.to_csv('annotations.csv')
```

## Installation

You can install `napari-simpleannotate` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-simpleannotate



To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/hiroalchem/napari-simpleannotate.git


## How to use

### Getting Started

After installing napari-simpleannotate, launch napari and navigate to `Plugins > Add dock widget` to find three annotation widgets:

- **Bbox annotation**: For bounding box annotation on images
- **Bbox video annotation**: For bounding box annotation on video files  
- **Label image classification**: For image classification labeling

### Bounding Box Annotation (Images)

**Prerequisites**: None required

1. **Opening Files**:
   - Single file: Click `Open File` to select an image file
   - Directory: Click `Open Directory` to select a folder containing images
   - If a `class.yaml` file exists in the directory, you'll be prompted to load existing classes

2. **Class Management**:
   - Enter class names in the text box and click `Add class`
   - Classes are automatically assigned sequential IDs (0, 1, 2, ...)
   - Select a class and click `Delete selected class` to remove it
   - Classes are saved to `class.yaml` alongside annotations

3. **Creating Annotations**:
   - Select a class from the list (becomes your active class)
   - Use napari's rectangle tool (shortcut: R) to draw bounding boxes
   - New rectangles automatically inherit the selected class
   - Change existing rectangles: select the shape, then click a different class

4. **Saving Work**:
   - Click `Save Annotations` to export in YOLO format
   - Files saved: `image_name.txt` (YOLO coordinates) + `class.yaml` (class definitions)
   - YOLO format: `class_id x_center y_center width height` (normalized 0-1)

### Video Bounding Box Annotation

**Prerequisites**: Install PyAV for video support: `pip install av`

1. **Opening Videos**:
   - Click `Open Video` to select video files
   - Supported formats: MP4, AVI, MOV, MKV, WMV, FLV, WebM
   - Video loads with frame-by-frame navigation

2. **Navigation**:
   - Use napari's time slider to navigate frames
   - Frame counter shows current position: ""Frame: X/Y""
   - **Keyboard shortcuts**: Q (previous annotation), W (next annotation)
   - Click navigation buttons to jump to nearest annotations
   - Video performance optimized with LRU cache and parallel prefetching

3. **Frame-Aware Annotation**:
   - Navigate to target frame before annotating
   - Create bounding boxes with napari's rectangle tool
   - Each annotation automatically records the current frame number
   - Annotations only visible on their respective frames

4. **Class and Export**:
   - Class management identical to image annotation
   - Extended YOLO format: `class_id frame x_center y_center width height`
   - Saves to `video_name.txt` + `class.yaml` in video directory

### Image Classification Labeling

**Prerequisites**: None required

1. **Opening Directory**:
   - Click `Open Directory` to select image folder
   - Recursively finds all images (PNG, TIF, JPG, JPEG, TIFF)
   - Automatically loads existing `labels.csv` and `class.txt` if present

2. **Display Options**:
   - **Split Channels**: Check to display multi-channel images as separate layers
   - Contrast settings preserved when switching between images
   - Navigate images using the file list on the left

3. **Labeling Workflow**:
   - Add classes: Type in text box and press Enter (or click `Add class`)
   - Remove classes: Type existing class name and press Enter
   - Assign labels: Select image → Click class name to label it
   - Real-time auto-save to `labels.csv` and `class.txt`

4. **Resume Sessions**:
   - Previous work automatically loaded when reopening directories
   - Continue labeling from where you left off

## Performance Notes

- **Video annotation**: Optimized with frame caching and parallel prefetching for smooth playback
- **Large datasets**: Classification widget handles thousands of images efficiently  
- **Memory management**: LRU cache prevents memory overflow during long annotation sessions

## Output Formats

| Widget | Annotation File | Class File | Format |
|--------|----------------|------------|---------|
| Bbox (Images) | `image.txt` | `class.yaml` | YOLO standard |
| Bbox (Video) | `video.txt` | `class.yaml` | Extended YOLO with frame |
| Classification | `labels.csv` | `class.txt` | CSV with image-label pairs |

## Installation



First, we advise you to create a conda environment in Python 3.10, in which you will run Napari:

    conda create -n sketchpose_env python=3.10
    conda activate sketchpose_env
    conda install pip
    python -m pip install ""napari[all]"" --upgrade

You can install `napari_sketchpose` via [pip]:

    pip install napari_sketchpose

WARNING:

For Windows users, CUDA version of PyTorch may not be installed properly. When the plugin starts for the first time, it checks whether
CUDA version is installed. If not, it tries to install it using light-the-torch library. If this does not work, you should re-install 
CUDA torch and torchvision versions manually, otherwise the plugin will not work properly.

## Tutorial

We strongly recommend reading the [documentation] to get the most out of the plugin.
A step-by-step tutorial illustrated with GIFs will guide you through the various stages.

Process images using [SimpleITK](https://simpleitk.org/) in [napari]

## Usage

Filters, segmentation algorithms and measurements provided by this napari plugin can be found in the `Tools` menu. 
You can recognize them with their suffix `(n-SimpleITK)` in brackets.
Furthermore, it can be used from the [napari-assistant](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-assistant) graphical user interface. 
Therefore, just click the menu `Tools > Utilities > Assistant (na)` or run `naparia` from the command line.

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-simpleitk-image-processing/raw/main/docs/screenshot_with_assistant.png)

All filters implemented in this napari plugin are also demonstrated in [this notebook](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-simpleitk-image-processing/blob/main/docs/demo.ipynb).

### Gaussian blur

Applies a [Gaussian blur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur)
to an image. This might be useful for denoising, e.g. before applying the Threshold-Otsu method.

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-simpleitk-image-processing/raw/main/docs/gaussian_blur.png)

### Median filter

Applies a [median filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_filter) to an image. 
Compared to the Gaussian blur this method preserves edges in the image better. 
It also performs slower.

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-simpleitk-image-processing/raw/main/docs/median_filter.png)

### Bilateral filter

The [bilateral filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateral_filter) allows denoising an image
while preserving edges.

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-simpleitk-image-processing/raw/main/docs/bilateral.png)

### Threshold Otsu

Binarizes an image using [Otsu's method](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4310076).

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-simpleitk-image-processing/raw/main/docs/threshold_otsu.png)

### Connected Component Labeling

Takes a binary image and labels all objects with individual numbers to produce a label image.

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-simpleitk-image-processing/raw/main/docs/connected_component_labeling.png)

### Measurements

This function allows determining intensity and shape statistics from labeled images. I can be found in the `Tools > Measurement tables` menu.

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-simpleitk-image-processing/raw/main/docs/measurements.png)

### Signed Maurer distance map

A distance map (more precise: [Signed Maurer Distance Map](https://itk.org/ITKExamples/src/Filtering/DistanceMap/MaurerDistanceMapOfBinary/Documentation.html)) can be useful for visualizing distances within binary images between black/white borders. 
Positive values in this image correspond to a white (value=1) pixel's distance to the next black pixel.
Black pixel's (value=0) distance to the next white pixel are represented in this map with negative values.

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-simpleitk-image-processing/raw/main/docs/signed_maured_distance_map.png)

### Binary fill holes

Fills holes in a binary image.

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-simpleitk-image-processing/raw/main/docs/binary_fill_holes.png)

### Touching objects labeling

Starting from a binary image, touching objects can be splits into multiple regions, similar to the [Watershed segmentation in ImageJ](https://imagej.net/plugins/classic-watershed).

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-simpleitk-image-processing/raw/main/docs/Touching_object_labeling.png)

### Morphological Watershed

The [morhological watershed](http://insightsoftwareconsortium.github.io/SimpleITK-Notebooks/Python_html/32_Watersheds_Segmentation.html)
allows to segment images showing membranes. Before segmentation, a filter such as the Gaussian blur or a median filter
should be used to eliminate noise. It also makes sense to increase the thickness of membranes using a maximum filter. 
See [this notebook](https://github.com/clEsperanto/pyclesperanto_prototype/blob/master/demo/segmentation/segmentation_2d_membranes.ipynb) for details.

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-simpleitk-image-processing/raw/main/docs/morphological_watershed.png)

### Watershed-Otsu-Labeling

This algorithm uses [Otsu's thresholding method](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4310076) in combination with 
[Gaussian blur](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_blur) and the 
[Watershed-algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watershed_(image_processing)) 
approach to label bright objects such as nuclei in an intensity image. The alogrithm has two sigma parameters and a 
level parameter which allow you to fine-tune where objects should be cut (`spot_sigma`) and how smooth outlines 
should be (`outline_sigma`). The `watershed_level` parameter determines how deep an intensity valley between two maxima 
has to be to differentiate the two maxima. 
This implementation is similar to [Voronoi-Otsu-Labeling in clesperanto](https://github.com/clEsperanto/pyclesperanto_prototype/blob/master/demo/segmentation/voronoi_otsu_labeling.ipynb).


![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-simpleitk-image-processing/raw/main/docs/watershed_otsu_labeling.png)

### Richardson-Lucy Deconvolution

[Richardson-Lucy deconvolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richardson%E2%80%93Lucy_deconvolution)
allows to restore image quality if the point-spread-function of the optical system used 
for acquisition is known or can be approximated.

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-simpleitk-image-processing/raw/main/docs/Richardson-Lucy-Deconvolution.png)

napari-skimage gives easy access to scikit-image functions in napari. The main goal of the plugin is to allow new users of napari, especially without coding experience, to easily explore basic image processing, in a similar way to what is possible in Fiji.

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

## Philosophy

The plugin is still in early development and does not cover all functions of scikit-image. If you are interested in a specific function, please open an issue or a pull request. scikit-image functions are turned into interactive widgets mostly via magicgui, a tool that allows to create GUIs from functions in a simple way (in particular not requiring Qt knowledge). The code avoids on purpose complex approaches, e.g. to automate the creation of widgets, in order to keep the code simple and easy to understand for beginners.

## Installation

You can install `napari-skimage` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-skimage



To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/guiwitz/napari-skimage.git

## Usage

The plugin function can be accessed under ```Plugins -> napari-skimage```. Each function will appear as a widget on the right of the napari window. Some functions such as ```Gaussian Filter``` give access to a single operation and its options. Some functions such as ```Thresholding``` give access to variants of the same operation via a dropdown menu. Currently the plugin does not support multi-channel processing and will consider those as stacks. At the moment, the plugin offers access to the following operation types.

### Filtering

A set of classical filters: Gaussian, Prewitt, Laplace etc. as well as rank filters such as median, minimum, maximum etc.

![Gaussian filter](docs/gaussian.png)

### Thresholding
A set of thresholding methods: Otsu, Li, Yen etc.
![Thresholding](docs/thresholding.png)

### Binary morphological operations
A set of binary morphology operations: binary erosion, binary dilation etc.
![Binary morphological operations](docs/binary_morphology.png)

### Morphological operations
A set of morphological operations: erosion, dilation, opening, closing etc.
![Morphological operations](docs/morphology.png)

### Restoration
A set of restoration operations such as rolling ball, or non-local means denoising.
![Restoration](docs/denoise_nl.png)

### Mathematics 
In addition the plugin provides a set of simple mathematical operators to:
- operate on single images e.g. square, square root, log etc.
- operate on two images e.g. add, subtract, multiply etc.
![Mathematics](docs/simple_maths.png)

## Code structure

Each set of functions is grouped in a separate module. For example all filtering operations are grouped in ```src/napari_skimge/skimage_filter_widget.py```. A set of test in ```src/_tests/test_basic_widgets.py``` simply check that each widget can be created and generated an output of the correct size using the default settings.

A [napari] plugin for measuring properties of labeled objects based on [scikit-image]



![](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-skimage-regionprops/raw/master/images/interactive.gif)



## Usage: measure region properties



From the menu `Tools > Measurement > Regionprops (nsr)` you can open a dialog where you can choose an intensity image, a corresponding label image and the features you want to measure:



![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-skimage-regionprops/raw/master/images/dialog.png)



If you want to interface with the labels and see which table row corresponds to which labeled object, use the label picker and

activate the `show selected` checkbox.



![](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-skimage-regionprops/raw/master/images/interactive.png)



If you closed a table and want to reopen it, you can use the menu `Tools > Measurements > Show table (nsr)` to reopen it. 

You just need to select the labels layer the properties are associated with.



For visualizing measurements with different grey values, as parametric images, you can double-click table headers.



![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-skimage-regionprops/raw/master/images/label_value_visualization.gif)



## Usage: measure point intensities



Analogously, also the intensity and coordinates of point layers can be measured using the menu `Tools > Measurement > Measure intensity at point coordinates (nsr)`. 

Also these measurements can be visualized by double-clicking table headers:



![img.png](measure_point_intensity.png)



![img_1.png](measure_point_coordinate.png)



## Working with time-lapse and tracking data



Note that tables for time-lapse data should include a column named ""frame"", which indicates which slice in

time the given row refers to. If you want to import your own csv files for time-lapse data make sure to include this column.

If you have tracking data where each column specifies measurements for a track instead of a label at a specific time point,

this column must not be added.



In case you have 2D time-lapse data you need to convert it into a suitable shape using the function: `Tools > Utilities > Convert 3D stack to 2D time-lapse (time-slicer)`,

which can be found in the [napari time slicer](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-time-slicer).



Last but not least, make sure that in case of time-lapse data the label image has labels that are subsquently labeled per timepoint.

E.g. a dataset where label 5 is missing at timepoint 4 may be visualized incorrectly.



## Usage: multichannel or multi-label data



If you want to relate objects from one channels to objects from another channel, you can use `Tools > Measurement tables > Object Features/Properties (scikit-image, nsr)`. 

This plugin module allos you to answer questions like:

  - how many objects I have inside other objects?

  - what is the average intensity of the objects inside other objects?

For that, you need at least two labeled images in napari. You can relate objects along with their features. 

If intensity features are also wanted, then you also need to provide two intensity images. 

Below, there is a small example on how to use it. 

Also, take a look at [this example notebook](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-skimage-regionprops/blob/master/demo/measure_relationship_to_other_channels_plugin.ipynb).

 

 ![](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-skimage-regionprops/raw/master/images/things_inside_things_demo.gif)



## Usage, programmatically



You can also control the tables programmatically. See this 

[example notebook](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-skimage-regionprops/blob/master/demo/tables.ipynb) for details on regionprops and

[this example notebook](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-skimage-regionprops/blob/master/demo/measure_points.ipynb) for details on measuring intensity at point coordinates. For creating parametric map images, see [this notebook](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-skimage-regionprops/blob/master/demo/map_measurements.ipynb).

<img src=""https://github.com/GuignardLab/tapenade/blob/Packaging/imgs/tapenade3.png"" width=""100"">

A plugin to dynamically interact with the spatial correlation heatmap obtained by comparing two continuous fields of biophysical properties in 3D tissues.

If you use this plugin for your research, please [cite us](https://github.com/GuignardLab/tapenade/blob/main/README.md#how-to-cite).

`napari-spatial-correlation-plotter` is a [napari] plugin that is part of the [Tapenade](https://github.com/GuignardLab/tapenade) project. Tapenade is a tool for the analysis of dense 3D tissues acquired with deep imaging microscopy. It is designed to be user-friendly and to provide a comprehensive analysis of the data.

## Overview

While working with large and dense 3D and 3D+time gastruloid datasets, we found that being able to visualise and interact with the data dynamically greatly helped processing it.
During the pre-processing stage, dynamical exploration and interaction led to faster tuning of the parameters by allowing direct visual feedback, and gave key biophysical insight during the analysis stage.

This plugins allows the user to analyse the spatial correlations of two 3D fields loaded in Napari (e.g two fluorescent markers). The user can dynamically vary the analysis length scale, which corresponds to the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel used for smoothing the 3D fields. 
If a layer of segmented nuclei instances is additionally specified, the histogram is constructed by binning values at the nuclei level (each point corresponds to an individual nucleus). Otherwise, individual voxel values are used.
The user can dynamically interact with the correlation heatmap by manually selecting a region in the plot. The corresponding cells (or voxels) that contributed to the region's statistics will be displayed in 3D on an independant Napari layer for the user to interact with and gain biological insight.

<img src=""imgs/Fig_Napari_correlation.png"">

## Installation

The plugin obviously requires [napari] to run. If you don't have it yet, follow the instructions [here](https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/fundamentals/installation.html).

The simplest way to install `napari-spatial-correlation-plotter` is via the [napari] plugin manager. Open Napari, go to `Plugins > Install/Uninstall Packages...` and search for `napari-spatial-correlation-plotter`. Click on the install button and you are ready to go!

You can also install `napari-spatial-correlation-plotter` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-spatial-correlation-plotter

To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/jules-vanaret/napari-spatial-correlation-plotter.git

## Usage

<img src=""imgs/corr_0.png"">

Steps:
1. First, load your images (and optionally mask and labels) in Napari. You can drag and drop them from your file explorer to the Napari viewer, or open them using the `File > Open files...` menu.
2. Click on the `Plugins > Spatial Correlation Plotter` menu to open the plugin.
3. Select the first layer you want to study from the combo box `Quantity X`.
4. Select the second layer you want to study from the combo box `Quantity Y`. In this example, labels have loaded in step 1. Labels layers can be chosen as `Quantity X` or `Quantity Y` so that the quantity to study is the object instance density (in this example, the labels come from nuclei segmentation, so this leads to studying the nuclei density, or equivalently the cell density) or instance volume fraction.
5. Optionally, a mask layer (with boolean values, 0 for outside, 1 for inside) can be selected to restrict the analysis to a specific region of the image.
6. Optionally, a labels layer can be selected so that the histogram is constructed by binning values obtained by averaging the two fields in the segegmented instances (in this case, the quantitites will be averaged inside nuclei).
7. Use the `Blur sigma` slider to vary the length scale of the analysis. This corresponds to the standard deviation of the Gaussian kernel used for masked gaussian smoothing the 3D fields. If set to 0, no smoothing is applied, which can be useful to study the raw data or if the quantities are already coming from smoothed data.
8. Click on the `Compute correlation heatmap` button to compute and plot the correlation heatmap.
9. If the image does not properly fit in the window (e.g if the borders are cut), you can use the `Configure subplots > Tight layout` button to adjust the plot size.
10. You can adjust the histogram binning by changing the `Heatmap bins` sliders. If the histogram range is too large (e.g due to outliers), you can adjust the `Percentiles` sliders to focus on the most relevant part of the histogram. You can also check options to (i) `Show individual cells` to display the individual points that compose the histogram as an additional scatter, (ii) `Show linear fit` to display the linear fit of the histogram, (iii) `Display quadrants` to display vertical and horizontal lines that divide the histogram in 4 quadrants. The lines are placed at the median of the histogram values in X and Y. For instance, once checked, these options lead to the following plot:

<img src=""imgs/corr_1.png"" width=280>

11. You can click on the `Save the figure` button to save the current plot (many formats are available, including .png, .svg, .jpeg).
12. You can interact with the plot by manually drawing a region of interest directly on the plot to automatically select and display the corresponding cells in 3D on an independant Napari Labels layer `clustered labels`. By using a left click, you can draw an arbitrary shape. By using a right click, you can draw a rectangle. If `Shift` is pressed while drawing, several groups of cells can appear on the `clustered labels` layer, each with a different color.
13. To trigger the grid view like in the example image, you can click on the `Toggle grid mode` button. This will display all layers in a grid view. By right clicking the button, you can parametrize the grid view (e.g number of columns, number of rows, etc).
14. You can switch between 2D and 3D view at all time by clicking on the `Toggle 2D/3D view` button (it resembles a square when in 2D mode, or a cube when in 3D mode).

## Acknowledgements

The ""napari-clusters-plotter"" plugin [1] heavily inspired this plugin, most notably the `SelectFromCollection`, `MplCanvas` and `FigureToolbar` classes. The `PlotterWidget` class has been modified for the specific use case of this plugin, but the core functionalites have been adapted directly.
napari-clusters-plotter source code is available [here](https://github.com/BiAPoL/napari-clusters-plotter/tree/main).

A napari plugin for interactive visualization of decoded spots from spatial transcriptomic data stored as CSV

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using with [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

The plugin code was written by Sebastian Gonzalez-Tirado.

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/docs/plugins/index.html
-->
## Reader hookspec

`napari-spacetx-explorer` allows the user to open and visualize CSV files that
have point-data stored in a given format. The main target is for users who
want to analyze decoded spot maps from spatial omics experiments but it can
used as well for any other type of coordinate data where each point has assigned
a label (e. g. a gene) as a string and the x and y-coordinates of the point's center.
The header for these data must be 'target', 'xc', and 'yc', respectively.

![img.png](https://github.com/sebgoti/napari-spacetx-explorer/raw/main/docs/Read_Hookspec.png)

## Selecting genes

After loading the gene/target maps it is possible to select specific groups for better visualization.
This creates a new ""Points"" layer in napari with the selected groups displayed in different colors.

![img.png](https://github.com/sebgoti/napari-spacetx-explorer/raw/main/docs/_function_hookspec.png)

## Loading data in OME.ZARR format

The plugin napari-ome-zarr can be used to display whole-tissue images in addition to the spot maps produced with the 
`napari-spacetx-explorer` plugin.

![img.png](https://github.com/sebgoti/napari-spacetx-explorer/raw/main/docs/_ome_zarr_napari_spacetx_explorer.png)

## Installation

The easiest installation is via the ""Install/Uninstall Plugins..."" under the Plugins menu in napari.  
Another way is through [pip]

A Napari plugin for the reconstruction of Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM) with GPU acceleration (pytorch/cupy if installed).
Currently supports:    
   - conventional SIM data with a generic number of angles and phases (typically, 3 angles and 3 phases are used for resolution improvement in 2D, but any combination can be processed by the widget)
   - hexagonal SIM data with 7 phases, as used in [this] publication.
   - 3D SIM, for resolution enhancement in three dimensions. This is available in the [3dSIM] branch  

The SIM processing widget accepts image stacks organized in 5D (`angle`,`phase`,`z`,`y`,`x`).

The reshape widget can be used to easily reshape the data if they are not organized as 5D (angle,phase,z,y,x).

For 3D stacks (raw images) with multiple z-frames, a batch reconstruction method is available, as described [here].

Syntetic raw-image stacks of Structured Illumination Microscopy can be easily simulated using the napari [SIMulator] pluging.

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/plugins/index.html
-->

## Installation

You can install `napari-sim-processor` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-sim-processor


To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/andreabassi78/napari-sim-processor.git


## Usage

1) Open napari. 

2) Launch the reshape and sim-processor widgets.

3) Open your raw image stack (using the napari built-in or your own file opener).

![raw](https://github.com/andreabassi78/napari-sim-processor/raw/main/images/Picture1.png)

4) If your image is ordered as a 5D stack (angle, phase, z-frame, y, x) go to point 6. 

5) In the reshape widget, select the actual number of acquired angles, phases, and frames (red arrow) and press `Reshape Stack`.
 Note that the label axis of the viewer will be updated (green arrow).

![raw](https://github.com/andreabassi78/napari-sim-processor/raw/main/images/Picture1b.png)

6) In the sim-reconstruction widget press the Select image layer button. Note that the number of phases and angles will be updated (blue arrow). 

7) Choose the correct parameters of the SIM acquisition (`NA`, `pixelsize`, `M`, etc.) and processing parameters (`alpha`, `beta`, w, `eta`, `group`):
   - `w`: parameter of the Weiner filter.
   - `eta`: constant used for calibration. It should be slightly smaller than the carrier frequency (in pupil radius units).
   - `group`: for stacks with multiple z-frames, it is the number of frames that are used together for the calibration process.
	
For details on the other parameters see [here].

8) Calibrate the SIM processor, pressing the `Calibrate` button. This will find the carrier frequencies (red circles if the `Show Carrier` checkbox is selected), the modulation amplitude and the phase, using cross correlation analysis.

9) Click on the checkboxes to show the power spectrum of the raw image (`Show power spectrum`) or the cross-correlation (`Show Xcorr`), to see if the found carrier frequency is correct.

![raw](https://github.com/andreabassi78/napari-sim-processor/raw/main/images/Picture2.png)
**Napari viewer showing the cross-correlation of the raw stack. The red circles indicate the found carrier frequencies**

10) Run the reconstruction of a single plane (`SIM reconstruction`) or of a stack (`Stack reconstruction`). After execution, a new image_layer will be added to the napari viewer. Click on the `Batch reconstruction` checkbox in order to process an entire stack in one shot. Click on the pytorch checkbox for gpu acceleration.

## GPU processing

The underlying processing classes will use numpy (and FFTW if available) for 
its calculations. For GPU accelerated processing you need to have either the 
PyTorch (tested with torch v1.11.0+cu113) or the CuPy (tested with cupy-cuda113 
v10.4.0) package installed.  Make sure to match the package cuda version to the CUDA library 
installed on your system otherwise PyTorch will default to CPU and CuPy will not work at all.  

Both packages give significant speedup on even relatively modest CUDA GPUs compared 
to Numpy, and PyTorch running on the CPU only can show improvements relative to numpy 
and FFTW. Selection of which processing package to use is via a ComboBox in the 
napari_sim_processor widget.  Only available packages are shown. 

Other than requiring a CUDA GPU it is advisable to have significant GPU memory 
available, particularly when processing large datasets.  Batch processing is the 
most memory hungry of the methods, but can process 280x512x512 datasets on a 4GB GPU.

This repository contains a napari plugin for interactively exploring and annotating
SpatialData objects. Here you can find the [napari-spatialdata documentation]
(https://spatialdata.scverse.org/projects/napari/en/stable/notebooks/spatialdata.html). `napari-spatialdata` is part of the `SpatialData` ecosystem. To learn more about SpatialData, please see the [spatialdata documentation](https://spatialdata.scverse.org/).

## Installation

You can install `napari-spatialdata` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-spatialdata[all]

The `all` command will install the qt bindings `PyQt5`.

You can find more details on this in the [installation instructions](https://spatialdata.scverse.org/en/stable/installation.html).

## Using napari-spatialdata as default zarr reader

If you would like to use the plugin as the default zarr reader, in napari please go to `File` -> `Preferences`
-> `Plugins` and follow the instructions under `File extension readers`.

## Development Version

You can install `napari-spatialdata` from Github with:

    pip install git+https://github.com/scverse/napari-spatialdata

Or, you can also install in editable mode after cloning the repo by:

    git clone https://github.com/scverse/napari-spatialdata
    cd napari-spatialdata
    pip install -e .

Note: when performing an editable install of `napari-spatialdata`, `spatialdata`
will be reinstalled from `pip`. So, if you previously also made an editable install
of `spatialdata`, you need to re-run `pip install -e .` on the `spatialdata`
repository. Please find more details on this in the [installation instructions](https://spatialdata.scverse.org/en/stable/installation.html).

## Getting started

To learn how to use the `napari-spatialdata` plugin, please see the [documentation](https://spatialdata.scverse.org/projects/napari/en/stable/notebooks/spatialdata.html).
To learn how to integrate napari-spatialdata into your analysis workflows, please
see the [SpatialData tutorials](https://spatialdata.scverse.org/en/stable/tutorials/notebooks/notebooks.html). In particular:

napari plugin to interactively train and test a StarDist model

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started


and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/stable/plugins/index.html
-->

## Description

This plugin provides tools for annotating spots in a 3D two-channel image (hdf5 type input file),
submitting tiles for StarDist model generation or model re-training, and refining initial annotations
based on predictions (kind of human-in-the-loop approach).

The objects of interest in the image are sphere-like spots with a diameter of just a
few pixels and are thus well suited for StarDist instance segmentation. The image 
dimensions are typically 1024x1024 pixels in xy and ≥ 64 sections in z.


## Installation

With python and pip installed (e.g., via miniconda or miniforge),
it is recommended to create a new environment and install `napari-spofi` using pip.

    pip install napari napari-spofi

## Starting `napari-spofi`

Start `napari` and select ""spot finder (napari-spofi)"" from the ""plugin"" menu.

### Annotate image
Go to the 'annotation' section of the widget and create a new directory for annotations. Add an image
folder containing at least one h5 file (foreground and background, e.g., 'ch1' & 'ch2'). Select an image file, foreground and background
channels. Load the image file.

Inspect the image for distinct regions. To help locate relevant tile positions, make
the 'checkerboard' layer visible. While the 'tiles' layer is active, double-click a tile
to add it to the list of tiles. This list will be used to generate a set of 
images and masks for training purposes.

Switch to napari's 2D view. Navigate to the centre section of each spot in the active tile
and annotate by adding points (one point per spot) using the 'true' points layer. The
built-in heuristic will automatically annotate pixels that belong to individual spots.
Some image enhancement step before loading images may be beneficial. 

Annotate tiles in one or a multiple images.
To prepare training data, use the 'extract spots' button.

### Train a StarDist model
Go to the 'training' section of the widget. Adjust the ""number of epochs"". For a first
check, 100 epochs is a good start. The plugin uses a simplified setup for StarDist
configurations (please see [StarDist](https://github.com/stardist/stardist/) for a full discussion).

Start training and watch the 'loss' and 'val_loss' values, which should decrease
steadily while their ratio should roughly remain at 1 as training progresses.

The retrain option allows the selection of an existing model for retraining.

### Predict instances
Go to the 'prediction' section of the widget to start spot prediction for the
currently loaded image. Select the appropriate model from the given annotation
directory. The 'threshold' value is calculated from the validation data and can be
adjusted. Start a new prediction and load the predicted spots when the process has
finished. (It is possible to load an existing prediction).

### Polish annotation
Predicted spots will be loaded into two new layers: 'predicted' and 'edited'. The
'predicted' layer is not editable and gives an overview of the spots found. Check
your annotation in the active tiles ('true' layer) and compare it carefully with
the spots in the 'edited' layer.
Adjust the positions of the spots or remove any incorrect spots from the 'edited'
layer. Extract the spots and train a new model or retrain the model.

# napari-stitcher

A napari plugin for stitching large multi-positioning datasets in 2/3D+t using [`multiview-stitcher`](https://github.com/multiview-stitcher/multiview-stitcher).

![](docs/images/napari-stitcher-loaded-mosaic-annotated.png)
<small>Image data by Arthur Michaut @ Jérôme Gros Lab @ Institut Pasteur.</small>

#### Quick guide:

1. Directly stitch napari layers: Use napari to load, visualize and [preposition](prearrangement.md) the tiles to be stitched.
2. When working with multi-channel data, stick to the following [naming convention](naming_convention.md): `{tile} :: {channel}`.
3. Load either all or just a subset of the layers into the plugin.
4. Choose registration options: registration channel, binning and more.
5. Stitching = registration (refining the positions, optional) + fusion (joining the tiles into a single image).
6. The registration result is shown in the viewer and the fused channels are added as new layers.

## Demo

This napari plugin allows to segment and extract information from Imaging Mass Cytometry data by combining the [cellpose](http://www.cellpose.org/) and [steinbock](https://bodenmillergroup.github.io/steinbock/v0.14.2/) tools.

## Installation

In order to use this plugin, whe highly recommend to create a specific environment and to install the required software in it. You can create a conda environment using:

    conda create -n steinpose python=3.8.5 napari -c conda-forge

Then activate it and install the plugin:
    
    conda activate steinpose
    pip install napari-steinpose

### Potential issue with PyTorch

Cellpose and therefore the plugin and napari can crash without warning in some cases with ```torch==1.12.0```. This can be fixed by reverting to an earlier version using:
    
    pip install torch==1.11.0

### GPU

In order to use a GPU:

1. Uninstall the PyTorch version that gets installed by default with Cellpose:

        pip uninstall torch

2. Make sure your have up-to-date drivers for your NVIDIA card installed.

3. Re-install a GPU version of PyTorch via conda using a command that you can find [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) (this takes care of the cuda toolkit, cudnn etc. so **no need to install manually anything more than the driver**). The command will look like this:

        conda install pytorch torchvision cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch

### Plugin Updates

To update the plugin, you only need to activate the existing environment and install the new version:

    conda activate steinpose
    pip install git+https://github.com/guiwitz/napari-steinpose.git -U

## Usage

Here is a short summary on how to proceed to use the plugin. For more detailed information, please visit [this page](https://guiwitz.github.io/napari-steinpose).

### Load data

Using the ""Select data folder"" button, select a folder containing your .mcd files. The contents of the folder will appear in the List of images box. When you select one of the files it is loaded in the viewer. Using the ROI spinpox, you can change the roi (or acquisition) to be visualized.
### Segmentation

1. In the channels tab, choose the combination of channels to use to define images to segment. You can choose what type of projection (mean, min etc.) is used to combine channels. You can either select channels defining both cells and nuclei or just a single channel. **Note that if you want to just segment nuclei, you need to select them as ""cell channel"".**

2. To save the output, select a folder using the ""Select output folder"" button.

3. In the segmentation tab, pick a cellpose model to use. If you use one of the built-in models, you can specify the average diameter of objects to detect.

4. In the Options tab, you can set a few more options:
   - cellpose options: you can adjust the flow threshold and cell probabilities. If cells are missing try to use higher values of flow threshold (close to 1) and lower values for the cell probabilities (around -6)
   - segmentation options: you can decide to remove segmentation touching the image border, and you can also decide to expand the segmented objects by a fixed number of pixels. If a segmentation is displayed in the viewer, adjusting this parameter will live-adjust the mask.

5. You can first test the segmentation using the ""Run on current image"" button. Once segmentation is done, the corresponding mask is displayed. You can then run the segmentation over all ROIs of **all .mcd files** present in the folder by using the ""Run on folder"" button.

### Post-processing

In the Segmentation tab, if you tick the box ""Run steinbock post-processing"", information will directly be extracted from images and masks at the end of segmentation. Processing is done via steinbock and generates files compatible with further downstream processing.

In the Export tab, you can select what type of information to export: object intensities, geometric properties and object neighbourhood. Note that if you have performed a segmentation without post-processing, you can still run post-processing using the ""Run steinbock postproc"" button.

### Saving settings

To avoid having to re-type the same settings repeatedly, you can export a give configuration using the ""Export config"" button in the Options tab. This generates a human readable .yml file with:
- segmentation options
- channels selected for projections

The file is saved in the output folder. You can just copy the file in a new empty output folder to use it for an other analysis run. Once you select that folder containing a configuration file, you can import it with the ""Import config"" button. **Note that you need to have an image opened so that channels can be selected properly.**

* [Label layers](https://napari.org/howtos/layers/labels.html): The label data is converted to surface data under the hood using the [marching cubes algorithm](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.measure.html#skimage.measure.marching_cubes) implemented in [scikit-image](https://scikit-image.org/) and is then exported using [Vedo](https://vedo.embl.es/). Warning: This can be slow for large image data!

### Import/export

**Interactively:** To export the data, simply save the selected layer with `File > Save Selected Layer(s)` and specify the file ending to be `some_file.[file_ending]`, for supported file types, see above. Similarly, supported file types can be imported into Napari with `File > `

**From code**: A [Napari Label layer](https://napari.org/api/napari.layers.Labels.html) can be added to the viewer as described in the [napari reference](https://napari.org/gallery/add_labels.html?highlight=add_labels) with this code snippet:

```python
import napari
import numpy as np

# Load and binarize image
label_image = np.zeros((100, 100, 100), dtype=int)
label_image[25:75, 25:75, 25:75] = 1

# Add data to viewer
viewer = napari.Viewer()
label_layer = viewer.add_labels(data, name='3D object')

# save the layer as 3D printable file to disc
napari.save_layers(r'/some/path/test.stl', [label_layer])
```

### Sample data
You can create sample label/surface data for export using the built-in functions as shown here:

![](https://github.com/jo-mueller/napari-stl-exporter/raw/main/doc/1_sample_data.png)

...or from code with

```Python
import napari_stl_exporter

pyramid = napari_stl_exporter.make_pyramid_surface()

```

### 3D-printing
To actually send your object to a 3D-printer, it has to be further converted to the *.gcode* format with a Slicer program. The latter convert the 3D object to machine-relevant parameters (printing detail, motor trajectories, etc). Popular slicers are:

* [Slic3r](https://slic3r.org/): Documentation [here](https://manual.slic3r.org/intro/overview)
* [Prusa Slicer](https://www.prusa3d.com/prusaslicer/): Tutorial [here](https://help.prusa3d.com/en/article/first-print-with-prusaslicer_1753)

*Note*: You can also upload the STL file to [github.com](https://github.com) and interact with it in the browser:

![](https://github.com/jo-mueller/napari-stl-exporter/raw/main/doc/pyramid_browser_screenshot.png)

#### Digital elevation models

DIgital elevation models (DEMs) can be printed with the napari-stl-exporter following these steps:

1. Go to the [open topography repository](https://portal.opentopography.org/raster?opentopoID=OTSDEM.032021.4326.2) and select a region of your choice, then download it as a GeoTiff file (`.tif`, intensity encodes elevation)
2. Open the downloaded tif image use the image conversion plugin (´Plugins > napari-stl-exporter > 2D image to surface´) to convert the downloaded image to a surface. CHeck the `solidify` option to make it readily 3D-printable.

![](https://github.com/jo-mueller/napari-stl-exporter/raw/main/doc/landscape_to_surface.png)

3. Export the created surface layer as `.stl` or `.ply` file. Open it in your Slicer of choice (you may have to scale it according to the size limitations of your printer) and off you go!

# napari-stress

This plugin provides tools for the analysis of surfaces in Napari, such as utilities to determine and refine the surface-representation of objects using a ray-casting approach and calculate the curvature of surfaces.
It re-implements code in Napari that was written for [Gross et al. (2021): STRESS, an automated geometrical characterization of deformable particles for in vivo measurements of cell and tissue mechanical stresses](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.26.437148v1)
and has been made open source in [this repository](https://github.com/campaslab/STRESS).

The aim of this plugin is to classify the output of a segmentation algorithm.
The inputs are :
<ul>
  <li>A folder of raw images</li>
  <li>Their segmentation masks where each ROI has its own label.</li>
</ul>

Svetlana can process 2D, 3D and multichannel image. If you want to use it to work on cell images, we strongly
recommend the use of [Cellpose](https://www.cellpose.org) for the segmentation part, as it provides excellent quality results and a standard output format
accepted by Svetlana (labels masks).

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/plugins/stable/index.html
-->

## Installation

First install Napari in a Python 3.9 Conda environment following these instructions :

```bash
conda create -n svetlana_env python=3.9
conda activate svetlana_env
conda install pip
python -m pip install ""napari[all]""==0.4.17
```

Then, you can install `napari_svetlana` via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/napari-svetlana/), or directly from the Napari plugin manager (see Napari documentation):
```bash
pip install napari_svetlana
```
WARNING:

If you have a Cuda compatible GPU on your computer, some computations may be accelerated
using [Cupy](https://pypi.org/project/cupy/). Unfortunately, Cupy needs Cudatoolkit to be installed. This library can only be installed via 
Conda while the plugin is a pip plugin, so it must be installed manually for the moment:
```bash
conda install cudatoolkit=11.5 
```
Also note that the library ([Cucim](https://pypi.org/project/cucim/)) that we use to improve these performances, computing morphological operations on GPU
is unfortunately only available for Linux systems. Hence, if you are a Windows user, this installation is not necessary.

## Tutorial

Many advanced features are available in Svetlana, such as data augmentation or contextual information reduction, to optimize the performance of your classifier. Thus, we strongly encourage you to
check our [Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u_FKuHta-RE) and
our [documentation](https://svetlana-documentation.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
A button called **TRY ON DEMO IMAGE** is available in the annotation plugin and enables you to apply the YouTube
tutorial to the same test images to learn how to use the plugin. Feel free to try it to test all the features
that Svetlana offers.

## Similar Napari plugins

Joel Luethi developed a similar method for objects classification called [napari feature classifier](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-feature-classifier).
Also, [apoc](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification) by Robert Haase is available in Napari for pixels and objects classification.

## Features


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cba1820f-d0b5-436c-a981-62bae0e1a6ba




### IO
#### READER
- Your .swc should follow the following specs: http://www.neuronland.org/NLMorphologyConverter/MorphologyFormats/SWC/Spec.html
- the reader will create 2 napari layer: `point_layer` and `shape_layer`. Only `point_layer` is interactive, `shape_layer` is used to render path between swc points.
- The raw swc can be accessed in the point layer metadata. Such as `point_layer.metadata[""raw_swc""]`
- A `pd.DataFrame` object is also saved in the metadata: `point_layer.metadata[""swc_data""]`
#### WRITER
- With the `point_layer` selected, you can use napari interface to save with `.swc` extension name.
- You can also do it in command line: `napari.save_layers('test.swc', [point_layer])`
### Napari Interface
#### Structure ID and point symbol
In swc, structure id allow to label the type of neuron structure the point belongs to. In this plugin by default, the points will follow this symbol mapping:
```python
SWC_SYMBOL = {
    0: ""clobber"",  # undefined
    1: ""star"",  # soma
    2: ""disc"",  # axon
    3: ""triangle_down"",  # basal dendrite
    4: ""triangle_up"",  # apical dendrite
}
```
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/618aa000-370d-43f9-8645-8a3b7e9b9739)

You can also visualize the swc data in a table using the widget under `Plugin > SWC Editor Widget`

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ed43f4c2-582b-4bc1-bbb1-54e8d9487f1d)

When using the ""Show swc table"" you will have an interactive table widget:
- left-click on table: highlight + center on the corresponding point
- **double**-left-click on table: highlight + center on the correspongind point **+ zoom**
- selection on the point layer: highlight the corresponding row on the table

#### SWC Edition
**ALL INTERACTIONS ARE ONLY BOUND TO THE `point_layer`**
**THERE IS NO CTRL-Z (please save your progress)**
- **Add point**: You can edit the ""r"" and the ""structure_id"" using the `point_size` and `symbol` ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/44255691-ffa0-4f63-8368-499b0c8ff6a4)
- **Remove point**: (Select the point and press `1` or `suppr` or `delete`) All the link pointing to this point will be removed
- **Add edge**: Select 2 or more point(s) and press on your keyboard `l` (aka: link).
- **Remove edge**: Select 1 or more point(s) and press on your keyboard `u` (aka: unlink).

If you want to link point as you are adding them you have two solutions:
- press ""CTRL"" while you add points, this will create a link with the previously selected point
- use the `Plugin > SWC Editor Widget` Checkbox (""link previous node with new node (same as using CTRL+Click)""): when selected, all new points will be selected with the previously selected point

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1c9e5788-0e74-48ab-be0b-0fb74b35192c)


----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [copier] using the [napari-plugin-template].

## Features

- Load swc file(s) to napari viewer
- Display swc file(s) in napari viewer as points layers and lines layers
- Size of points and lines are using the radius of the swc file
- You can load an example swc from https://neuromorpho.org/dableFiles/jacobs/CNG%20version/204-2-6nj.CNG.swc or load it under `File` -> `Open Sample` -> `napari-swc-reader`

**Limitations:**
- Only support swc file(s) following specs http://www.neuronland.org/NLMorphologyConverter/MorphologyFormats/SWC/Spec.html 7 columns
- Cannot write swc file(s) to disk but you can access the raw swc data from the napari layers from `metadata` attribute with key `raw_swc`

**Roadmap:**
- Switch to use `napari.layers.Graph` [when it is available](https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/4274)

## Installation

You can install `napari-swc-reader` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-swc-reader

<img src=""https://github.com/GuignardLab/tapenade/blob/main/imgs/tapenade3.png"" width=""100"">

A collection of methods to process images of deep 3D/3D+time tissues in Napari.

`napari-tapenade-processing` is a [napari] plugin that is part of the [Tapenade](https://github.com/GuignardLab/tapenade) project. Tapenade is a tool for the analysis of dense 3D tissues acquired with deep imaging microscopy. It is designed to be user-friendly and to provide a comprehensive analysis of the data.

If you use this plugin for your research, please [cite us](https://github.com/GuignardLab/tapenade/blob/main/README.md#how-to-cite).

## Overview

<img src=""imgs/napari_preproc_demo.gif""/>

While working with large and dense 3D and 3D+time gastruloid datasets, we found that being able to visualise and interact with the data dynamically greatly helped processing it.
During the pre-processing stage, dynamical exploration and interaction led to faster tuning of the parameters by allowing direct visual feedback, and gave key biophysical insight during the analysis stage.

From a given set of raw images, segmented object instances, and object mask, the plugin allows the user to quickly run all pre-processing functions from our main pipeline with custom parameters while being able to see and interact with the result of each step. For large datasets that are cumbersome to manipulate or cannot be loaded in Napari, the plugin provides a macro recording feature: the users can experiment and design their own pipeline on a smaller subset of the dataset, then run it on the full dataset without having to load it in Napari.

<img src=""imgs/Fig_Napari_preprocessing.png"">

## Installation

The plugin obviously requires [napari] to run. If you don't have it yet, follow the instructions [here](https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/fundamentals/installation.html).

The simplest way to install `napari-tapenade-processing` is via the [napari] plugin manager. Open Napari, go to `Plugins > Install/Uninstall Packages...` and search for `napari-tapenade-processing`. Click on the install button and you are ready to go!

You can also install `napari-tapenade-processing` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-tapenade-processing

To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/jules-vanaret/napari-tapenade-processing.git

## Usage

### General overview of the plugin within Napari

<img src=""imgs/proc_0.png"">

To start a pre-processing pipeline, follow these steps:

1. First, load your images in Napari. You can drag and drop them from your file explorer to the Napari viewer, or open them using the `File > Open files...` menu.
2. Click on the `Plugins > Tapenade Processing` menu to open the plugin.
3. The image you have loaded will be displayed as individual layers in the Layer List. They can be clicked-on to reveal a set of visual parameters (see 4) that can be adjusted. By double-clicking on a layer name, you can change it. Right-clicking a layer will give you several options. The little eye icon next to the layer name can be clicked to hide the layer.
4. You can adjust visual parameters for each layer, like the contrast limits, the colormap, the opacity, the blending mode, etc.
5. If you want to switch between 2D and 3D views, click on the `Toggle 2D/3D view` button (it resembles a square when in 2D mode, or a cube when in 3D mode).
6. You can toggle the grid view (as shown in the example image) by clicking on the `Toggle grid mode` button. By right-clicking the button, you can parametrize the grid view (e.g number of columns, number of rows, etc).
7. The plugin is composed of three tabs. The first tab is dedicated to pre-processing functions, the second tab is dedicated to the macro recording feature, and the third tab is dedicated to advanced parameters.

### Tab 1: The pre-processing functions

<img src=""imgs/proc_1.png"" width=300>

The pre-processing tab is composed of the following elements:

1. A combo box to select the pre-processing function to apply from a list.
2. A set of comboxes that allow you to select the layers to apply the function on. If a function does not require a specific layer, the combo box will be greyed out. `Image` layers correspond to integer or float data, `Labels` layers correspond to integer data and represent segmented object instances, `Mask` layers correspond to boolean data and usually represent the sample's large scale mask (inside/outside). All layers must have data of the same shape (same number of dimensions and same dimensions). Layers can be 3D or 3D+time, respectively with the ZYX or TZYX order.
(2') If a layer does not appear in a combo box, but is present in the Layer List, you can click on the `Refresh` button to update the list of layers.
3. A set of parameters that you can tune to adjust the function's behaviour. The parameters are specific to each function. In case of doubt, you can click on the little `[?]` button next to the widget to get a tooltip with a description.
4. A `Run function` button to apply the function with the current parameters to the previously selected layers.


### Tab 2: The macro recording feature

#### A. Recording a macro

<img src=""imgs/proc_macro_1.png"" width=300>

To record a macro, click on the `Macro recording` tab and follow these steps:

1. Click on `Choose directory` to select a folder where the macro file will be saved.
2. Click on `Start recording macro` to start recording the functions you will apply. At this point, you can start applying sequences of functions to images/segementations/masks that you have already loaded in Napari or that you load in the middle of the recording. 

<img src=""imgs/proc_macro_2.png"" width=300>

3. When you are finished, click `Stop recording and save macro`. It will be saved in the JSON (`.json`) format, and the name will follow the pattern `recorder_parameters_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.json`.

#### B. Running a macro

Macros allow you to run a sequence of functions in batch on folders of input TIFF images (either different frames of the same 3D+t image, or several 3D images). The input images should be in the same folder, and the output will be saved in a folder of your choice. The output of each function will be saved in a separate folder, and the name of the folder will be linked to the name of the function.

<img src=""imgs/proc_macro_3.png"" width=300>

To run a macro, click on the `Macro recording` tab and follow these steps:

1. Click on `Select file` to choose the macro file you want to run.
2. After specifying the path to the macro file, several path entries with names like `Path to folder ([...]) N` (e.g `Path to folder (['Image'] 1`) will appear. Click on the `Choose directory` button to select the folder where the input images (TIFF files) are located.
3. Click on `Choose directory` under `Path to save outputs folders of tifs` to select the folder where the results of the pipeline will be saved. Each function call will generate a folder whose name will be linked to the name of the function.
4. You can click the `Compress when saving` checkbox to save the output TIFF images in a compressed format using ZLIB compression. 
5. Choose the number of workers to use for parallel processing. The default value is 1, which means that the functions will be run sequentially on the images. If you have a multi-core CPU, you can increase this value to speed up the processing. Be careful that setting this value too high can lead to memory issues.
6. Click on `Run macro` to start the processing. You will see as many folders as there are steps in your pipeline, containing the results on each frame.


### Tab 3: Advanced parameters

<img src=""imgs/proc_2.png"" width=300>

The advanced parameters tab is composed of the following elements:

1. A checkbox `New layers overwrite previous ones`: whether the output of the pre-processing functions should be saved as new layers or overwrite the previous ones that were used as input. This can be useful to save memory when you don't need to compare the input and output of a function.

## Demo dataset

A demo dataset is available [here](https://amubox.univ-amu.fr/s/MRdFy3KqQNjpyHa).

### Content

This test dataset is composed of a folder `folder_raw_data` which contains 5 separate frames (3D images), and a macro Json file `recorder_parameters.json`.  

### How to use

 - Download the folder `folder_raw_data`. 
 - Load one of the image from the folder (either drag and drop, or `File>Open file(s)`) and start creating your own pipeline.
 - To try batch processing through the macro feature, click on the `Macro recording tab`, choose a path to save the macro Json file, click on `Start recording macro`, and perform a sequence of function runs of your choice. When you are finished, click `Stop recording and save macro`. Then specify the path to your macro file below (alternatively, a valid Json file is also made available), the folder where the rest of the frames are located, and the folder where the results of the pipeline will be saved. Click on run macro. You should see as many folders as there are steps in your pipeline, containing the results on each frame.

meta plugin to ease processing timelapse image data

## API

This plugin exposes two principal funcionalities:

### TimelapseConverter

The `TimelapseConverter` class allows you to stack or unstack any of the supported napari layers from 4D data into a list of 3D layers or vice versa. Currently supported layers are:

- `napari.layers.Image`
- `napari.layers.Labels`
- `napari.layers.Points`
- `napari.layers.Vectors`
- `napari.layers.Surface`

`napari.layers.Tracks` are intrinsically 4D and thus not supported.

**Unstacking example usage:**

```python
from napari_timelapse_processor import TimelapseConverter
import numpy as np

image_4d = np.random.rand(10, 32, 32, 32)  # 10 timepoints of 32x32x32 data
converter = TimelapseConverter()
list_of_images = converter.unstack(image_4d, layertype='napari.types.ImageData')
```

**Stacking example usage:**

```python
from napari_timelapse_processor import TimelapseConverter
import numpy as np

random_points = [np.random.rand(10, 3)  for _ in range(10)]  # 10 timepoints of 10 random 3D points
converter = TimelapseConverter()

# stack the points into a single 4D layer
stacked_points = converter.stack(random_points, layertype='napari.types.PointsData')
```

The `TimeLapseConverter` class also supports (un)stacking the `napari.layers.Layer` type (and its above-listed subclasses). Importantly, `features` that are associated with the respective layer are also (un)stacked.

**Layer example usage**

```python
from napari_timelapse_processor import TimelapseConverter
import numpy as np
from napari.layers import Points
import pandas as pd

random_points = [np.random.rand(10, 3)  for _ in range(10)]  # 10 timepoints of 10 random 3D points
random_features = [pd.DataFrame(np.random.rand(10)) for _ in range(10)]  # 10 timepoints of 10 random feature values

# create a list of 10 Points layers
points = [Points(random_points[i], properties=random_features[i]) for i in range(10)]

converter = TimelapseConverter()
stacked_points = converter.stack(points, layertype='napari.layers.Points')
```

## frame_by_frame

The frame-by-frame functionality provides a decorator that will inspect the decorated function for `TimelapseConverter`-compatible arguments and, if a 4D value is passed as argument, will automatically (un)stack the data before and after the function call. This allows for a more intuitive API when working with timelapse data. Currently supported type annotations are:

- `napari.types.ImageData`
- `napari.types.LabelsData`
- `napari.types.PointsData`
- `napari.types.VectorsData`
- `napari.types.SurfaceData`
- `napari.layers.Layer`
- `napari.layers.Image`
- `napari.layers.Labels`
- `napari.layers.Points`
- `napari.layers.Vectors`
- `napari.layers.Surface`

Additionally, the `frame_by_frame` supports parallelization with [dask.distributed](https://distributed.dask.org/en/latest/). To use it, simply pass the `use_dask=True` argument to the decorated function, even if the function itself does not require this argument. The decorater will then automatically parallelize the function call over the time-axis and remove the `use_dask` argument when calling the function.

**Example interactive code usage:** If you want to use the `frame_by_frame` functionality in, say, a Jupyter notebook, use it like this:

```python

from napari_timelapse_processor import frame_by_frame
import numpy as np

def my_function(image: 'napari.types.ImageData') -> 'napari.types.ImageData':
    return 2 * image

image_4d = np.random.rand(10, 32, 32, 32)  # 10 timepoints of 32x32x32 data

image_4d_processed = frame_by_frame(my_function)(image_4d)  # without dask
image_4d_processed = frame_by_frame(my_function)(image_4d, use_dask=True)  # with dask
```

**Example napari code** If you want to use the `frame_by_frame` functionality in a napari plugin, use it like this:

```python
from napari_timelapse_processor import frame_by_frame

@frame_by_frame
def my_function(image: 'napari.types.ImageData') -> 'napari.types.ImageData':
    return 2 * image
```

**Hint:** The `frame_by_frame` functionality runs under the assumption that input napari-data (e.g., an Image, a Surface, Points, etc) are *always* arguments and any other parameters are *always* keyword arguments. If this is not the case, the decorator will not work as intended.

```python

# This works
frame_by_frame(my_function)(image_4d, some_parameter=2, use_dask=True)

# This does not work
frame_by_frame(my_function)(image=image_4d, some_parameter=2, use_dask=True)
```

## Description
Napari-time_series_plotter (TSP) is a plugin for the `napari` ndimensional image viewer. 

**TSP** adds live plotting of time-resolved images to napari. You can select and visualize pixel/voxel or ROI mean values from one or multiple image layers as intensity-over-time line plots (The first image dimension is handled as time) and save the figures or the underlying time series data as CSV file. TSP supports 3D to nD images (3D: t+2D, nD: t+nD).

**Plotting** is handeled by the `Explorer` widget, it offers three different plotting modes: Voxel, Shapes, Points
<br>--> Voxel mode offers live plotting while moving the cursor over an image layer
<br>--> Shapes mode offers shape-based ROI plotting the ROI combination method can be one of [Mean, Median, STD, Sum, Min, Max]; multiple ROIs can be plotted simultaneously
<br>--> Points mode offers simultaneous, point-based plotting of multiple voxels
<br>You can modify and save the plots through the canvas toolbar.
<br>Plotting powered by `napari-matplotlib`.

**Viewing** the time series as a table is handled by the `Inspector` widget. You can load the data you've plotted and inspect the single time point values of each selection. The columns are named like the plots in the `Explorer`. You can copy the whole tabe or a selection to the clipboard or directly expot it to a CSV file to save the time series.

----------------------------------

## Installation
You can either install the latest version via pip or conda.

**pip:**

    pip install napari-time-series-plotter

or download the packaged `tar.gz` file from the release assets and install it with 
    
    pip install /path/to/file.tar.gz

**conda:**

    conda install -c conda-forge napari-time-series-plotter


Alternatively, you can install the plugin directly in the `napari` viewer plugin manager, the napari hub, or the release assets.

<br>

To install the latest development version install directly from the relevant GitHub branch.

## Usage
### Basics and Live plotting

[![basic_demo](./demo_videos/TSP_basic_and_voxel_plotting_demo.jpg)](./demo_videos/TSP_basic_and_voxel_plotting_demo.webm)
    
1. Select the `TSPExplorer` widget in the `Plugins` tab of the napari viewer
2. Use the `LayerSelector` to choose the image layers you want to source for plotting
3. Move the corsor over the layer while holding ""Shift""

The `Options` tab offers multiple options to customize your plot. 
- Set custom title or axe labels
- Switch between autoscaling and manually defined max and min values of the axes
- Switch to label truncation in the options tab if your layer names are too long for the figure legend (set max length manually)
- Set a scaling factor for the X-axis

The plot can be modified and saved through its toolbar above.

### Plotting ROIs

[![roi_demo](./demo_videos/TSP_ROI_plotting_demo.jpg)](./demo_videos//TSP_ROI_plotting_demo.webm)

1. Select the Shapes plotting mode via the `Options` tab (Voxel mode is the default).
2. Use the `LayerSelector` to choose the image layers you want to source for plotting.
2. Add one ore more shapes to the ""ROI Selection"" layer.
   <br>The ""ROI Selection"" shapes are 2D only, effecting the currently displayed slice.
   <br>(newly added shapes might have to be moved before they are correctly plottet)
3. Reposition or remove shapes if needed.
4. Change the ROI mode in the `Options` tab (Default: mean).

### Plotting multiple Points

[![points_demo](./demo_videos/TSP_Points_plotting_demo.jpg)](./demo_videos/TSP_Points_plotting_demo.webm)

1. Select the Shapes plotting mode via the `Options` tab (Voxel mode is the default).
2. Use the `LayerSelector` to choose the image layers you want to source for plotting.
3. Add one or more points to the ""Point selection"" layer.
   <br>The points can be on different slices (3D and 4D support only) or images (grid mode)
4. Reposition or remove points if needed.

### View time series as table

[![points_demo](./demo_videos/TSP_Inspector_demo.jpg)](./demo_videos/TSP_Inspector_demo.webm)

1. Select the `TSPInspector` widget in the `Plugins` tab of the napari viewer
2. Press the load from plot button to load the currently displayed plots into the `Inspector`

You can copy the whole table or a selection to your clipboard or export it to CSV file through the buttons above.

The `napari-tmidas` plugin consists of a growing collection of pipelines for fast batch processing of confocal and whole slide microscopy images of biological tissues. This is a WIP and based on the CLI version of [T-MIDAS](https://github.com/MercaderLabAnatomy/T-MIDAS).

## Features
Currently, napari-tmidas provides pipelines as widgets for batch image conversion / cropping / processing, ROI colocalization and label inspection (cf. [Usage](#usage) below).

## Installation

(Video installation guides: https://www.youtube.com/@macromeer/videos)

First, install Napari in a virtual environment:

    mamba create -y -n napari-tmidas -c conda-forge python=3.11
    mamba activate napari-tmidas
    python -m pip install ""napari[all]""

Now you can install `napari-tmidas` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-tmidas

It is recommended though to install the **latest development version**. Please also execute this command from time to time in the activated environment to benefit from newly added features:

    pip install git+https://github.com/macromeer/napari-tmidas.git

To use the Batch Crop Anything pipeline, we need to install **Segment Anything 2** (2D/3D):

    cd /opt # if the folder does not exist: mkdir /opt && cd /opt
    git clone https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam2.git && cd sam2
    pip install -e .
    curl -L https://dl.fbaipublicfiles.com/segment_anything_2/092824/sam2.1_hiera_large.pt -o checkpoints/sam2.1_hiera_large.pt
    mamba install -c conda-forge ffmpeg # we also need ffmpeg

If you want to batch compress image data using [Zstandard](https://github.com/facebook/zstd), use the package manager of your operating system to install it:

   ~~sudo apt-get install zstd~~    # Pre-installed on Linux :man_shrugging:

    brew install zstd            # for macOS (requires [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
    pip install zstandard        # Windows with Python >= 3.7



And you are done! 

## Usage

To use the plugin, start napari in the activated virtual environment with this terminal command:

    mamba run -n napari-tmidas napari

You can then find the installed plugin in the Plugins tab.

### Microscopy Image Conversion

You can start this pipeline via `Plugins > T-MIDAS > Batch Microscopy Image Conversion`. Currently, this pipeline supports the conversion of `.nd2, .lif, .ndpi, .czi` and acquifer data. After scanning a folder of your choice for microscopy image data, select a file in the first column of the table and preview and export any image data it contains.


<img src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e377ca71-2f30-447d-825e-d2feebf7061b"" alt=""Microscopy Image Conversion Widget"" style=""width:75%; height:auto;"">


### Image Processing

1. After opening `Plugins > T-MIDAS > Batch Image Processing`, enter the path to the folder containing the images to be processed (currently supports TIF, later also ZARR). You can also filter for filename suffix.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/41ecb689-9abe-4371-83b5-9c5eb37069f9)

2. As a result, a table appears with the found images. You can click on them to inspect them in the viewer.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8360942a-be8f-49ec-bc25-385ee43bd601)

3. Next, select a processing function, set parameters if applicable and `Start Batch Processing`.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/05929660-6672-4f76-89da-4f17749ccfad)

4. You can click on the images in the table to show them in the viewer. For example first click on one of the `Original Files`, and then the corresponding `Processed File` to see an overlay.

<img src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/cfe84828-c1cc-4196-9a53-5dfb82d5bfce"" alt=""Image Processing Widget"" style=""width:75%; height:auto;"">


Note that whenever you click on an `Original File` or `Processed File` in the table, it will replace the one that is currently shown in the viewer. So naturally, you'd first select the original image, and then the processed image to correctly see the image pair that you want to inspect.


#### Processing Function Credits

The image processing capabilities are powered by several excellent open-source tools:
- [Cellpose 4](https://github.com/MouseLand/cellpose): Advanced cell segmentation
- [Trackastra](https://github.com/weigertlab/trackastra): Cell tracking and analysis
- [CAREamics](https://github.com/CAREamics/careamics): Content-aware image restoration and enhancement

### Batch Label Inspection
If you have already segmented a folder full of images and now you want to maybe inspect and edit each label image, you can use the `Plugins > T-MIDAS > Batch Label Inspection`, which automatically saves your changes to the existing label image once you click the `Save Changes and Continue` button (bottom right).

<img src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0bf8c6ae-4212-449d-8183-e91b23ba740e"" alt=""Batch Label Inspection Widget"" style=""width:75%; height:auto;"">

### Crop Anything
This pipeline combines the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for automatic object detection with an interactive interface for selecting and cropping multiple objects from images. To launch the widget, open `Plugins > T-MIDAS > Batch Crop Anything`. Cropping works like this: Enter 2D view and go to the first z slice where the object to be cropped is appearing. Activate/select the points layer and click on the object. Terminal shows progress. You can then proceed to select another object (always do this in 2D mode)

<img src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6d72c2a2-1064-4a27-b398-a9b86fcbc443"" alt=""Crop Anything Widget"" style=""width:75%; height:auto;"">




### ROI Colocalization
This pipeline quantifies colocalization between labeled regions of interest (ROIs) across multiple image channels. It determines the extent of overlap between ROIs in a reference channel and those in one or two other channels. The output is a table of colocalization counts. Optionally, the size of reference channel ROIs, as well as the total or median size of colocalizing ROIs in the other channels, can be included. Colocalization is determined using Boolean masking. The number of colocalizing instances is determined by counting unique label IDs within the overlapping regions. Typically, the reference channel contains larger structures, while other channels contain smaller, potentially nested, structures. For example, the reference channel might contain cell bodies, with the second and third channels containing nuclei and sub-nuclear objects, respectively.

## Introduction and usage

ToMoDL allows users to reconstruct tomography images from its raw projections juts from uploading them as an ordered stack of files into the napari viewer.

1 - Load ordered stack: Click File -> Open Files as Stack... and load the angular projections for parallel beam optical tomography reconstruction.

![plot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcoso96/ToMoDL/main/napari-tomodl/figures/fig3.png)

2 - Select the current volume in the dropdown menu with the button 'Select image layer'. Notice that the projections should be in grayscale and more than one slide in the stack.

![plot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcoso96/ToMoDL/main/napari-tomodl/figures/fig4.png)

3 - If the axis is not correctly aligned in acquisition time, we provide an algorithm to do so by clicking on 'Align axis'. This will align the sinogram respect to the center of the detector in order to maximise the variance of the reconstructions. See Walls et al. 

4 - Reshape the reconstructed volume to a desired size. This can be useful to prevent exhausting your computing capabilities.

5 - Clip to circle should be False by default.

6 - Choose if filtering should be used. By the moment we only allow using ramp filtering for FBP only (both CPU and GPU).

7 - Choose the correct order of the axis of the projections (T -> Theta axis, Q -> Detector axis)

8 - Reconstruct! A new Layer should be created on top of the projections stack containing the reconstructed volume.

A meta plugin for processing timelapse data timepoint by timepoint. It 
enables a list of napari plugins to process 2D+t or 3D+t data step by step when the user goes 
through the timelapse. Currently, these plugins are using `napari-time-slicer`:
* [napari-segment-blobs-and-things-with-membranes](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-segment-blobs-and-things-with-membranes)
* [napari-cupy-image-processing](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-cupy-image-processing)
* [napari-pyclesperanto-assistant](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-pyclesperanto-assistant)
* [napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-accelerated-pixel-and-object-classification)
* [napari-simpleitk-image-processing](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-simpleitk-image-processing)
* [napari-stress](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-stress)
* [napari-process-points-and-surfaces](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-process-points-and-surfaces)

`napari-time-slicer` enables inter-plugin communication, e.g. allowing to combine the plugins listed above in 
one image processing workflow for segmenting a timelapse dataset:

![](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-time-slicer/raw/main/images/screencast1.gif)

The workflow can then also be exported as a script. The 'Generate Code' button can be found in the [Workflow Inspector](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-workflow-inspector)


If you want to convert a 3D dataset into a 2D + time dataset, use the 
menu `Tools > Utilities > Convert 3D stack to 2D timelapse (time-slicer)`. It will turn the 3D dataset to a 4D datset
where the Z-dimension (index 1) has only 1 element, which will in napari be displayed with a time-slider. Note: It is 
recommended to remove the original 3D dataset after this conversion.

## Working with large on-the-fly processed datasets

Using the [napari-assistant](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-assistant) complex image processing workflows on timelapse datasets can be setup. 
In combination with the time-slicer it is possible to process time-lapse data that is larger than available computer memory.
In case the workflow only consists of images and label-images and out-of-memory issues arise, consider storing intermediate results on disk following this procedure: 
After setting up the workflow and testing it on a couple of selected frames, store the entire processed timelapse dataset to disk 
using the menu `Tools > Utilities > Convert to file-backed timelapse data (time-slicer)`. It will open this dialog, where you can select 
![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-time-slicer/raw/main/images/convert_to_file_backed_timelapse.png)

It is recommended to enter a folder location in the text field. 
If not provided, a temporary folder will be created, typically in the User's temp folder in the home directory. 
The user is responsible for emptying this folder from time to time.
The data stored in this folder can also be loaded into napari using its `File > Open Folder...` menu.

Executing this operation can take time as every timepoint of the timelapse is computed. 
Afterwards, there will be another layer available in napari, which is typically faster to navigate through. 
Consider removing the layer(s) that were only needed to determine the new file-backed layer.

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-time-slicer/raw/main/images/new_file_backed_layer.png)

## Usage for plugin developers

Plugins which implement the `napari_experimental_provide_function` hook can make use of the `@time_slicer`. At the moment,
only functions which take `napari.types.ImageData`, `napari.types.LabelsData` and basic python types such as `int` 
and `float` are supported. If you annotate such a function with `@time_slicer` it will internally convert any 4D dataset
to a 3D dataset according to the timepoint currently selected in napari. Furthermore, when the napari user changes the
current timepoint or the input data of the function changes, a re-computation is invoked. Thus, it is recommended to 
only use the `time_slicer` for functions which can provide [almost] real-time performance. Another constraint is that 
these annotated functions have to have a `viewer` parameter. This is necessary to read the current timepoint from the 
viewer when invoking the re-computions.

Example
```python
import napari
from napari_time_slicer import time_slicer

@time_slicer
def threshold_otsu(image:napari.types.ImageData, viewer: napari.Viewer = None) -> napari.types.LabelsData:
    # ...
```

You can see a full implementations of this concept in the napari plugins listed above.

If you want to combine slicing in time and processing z-stack images slice-by-slice, you can use the `@slice_by_slice` annotation.
Make sure, to insert it after `@time_slicer` as shown below and implemented in [napari-pillow-image-processing](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-pillow-image-processing/blob/4d846b226739843124953f16059241d917cde8e1/src/napari_pillow_image_processing/__init__.py#L151)

```python
from napari_time_slicer import slice_by_slice

@time_slicer
@slice_by_slice
def blur_2d(image:napari.types.ImageData, sigma:float = 1, viewer: napari.Viewer = None) -> napari.types.LabelsData:
    # ...
```

## Napari Tracer Plugin

The `Napari Tracer Plugin` provides an intuitive interface for users to load images, perform brightest path tracing, and visualize the results. This plugin, which is built on top of the Napari viewer, enables users to explore and annotate complex images, and take advantage of the viewer's built-in features such as zooming, panning, and adjusting contrast while viewing their tracings. The `Napari Tracer Plugin` uses the brightest path tracing algorithms from [brightest-path-lib](https://github.com/mapmanager/brightest-path-lib) to provide an interactive path building process for users to create traced segments in 2D and 3D images.

## Examples

<video loop muted autoplay controls >
  <source src=""sample-2d-tracing.mp4"" type=""video/mp4"">
</video>

You can download our [2D](data/sample-2d.tif) and [3D](sample-3d.tif) example tif files.

## Features

1. Load images and trace paths in 2D and 3D.
1. Offloads computations to a background thread to ensure a responsive user interface.
1. Two tracing modes: disjoint and continuous. Disjoint segments refer to paths that do not share any points, while continuous segments start from the endpoint of a previously traced path.
1. Verify traced segments and cancel tracing if necessary.
1. Save traced paths in SWC format commonly used in biology to represent neuronal morphology.
1. Load previously saved tracings in SWC format.

## Installation

You can install `napari-tracing` via pip:

    pip install napari-tracing

To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/mapmanager/napari-tracing.git

## Usage

Once installed, the Napari Tracer Plugin can be accessed from the Napari menu under ""Plugins"" > ""napari tracing: Tracer Widget"". This will open the plugin interface, where you can load your image and start tracing.

## Tracing

1. To trace a path, select the ""Trace"" mode and the image layer that you want to trace from their respective dropdowns.
2. Once you select the image, a points layer called the terminal points layer will be created on the Napari viewer where you can add the start and end point.
3. Click the ""Start Tracing"" button to perform brightest path tracing between the points.
4. The traced path will appear in a new points layer called the tracing result result layer in the Napari viewer as a line overlay.
5. Each new traced segment is verified, so you can either accept the tracing or reject it. If you choose to reject the tracing, you can try again with a different set of points if necessary.
6. You can click on the ""Cancel Tracing"" button to cancel a tracing that is in progress.

## Saving and loading tracings

1. To save a tracing, click on the ""Save Trace"" button from the plugin menu. This will save the traced path in SWC format to a file of your choosing.
1. To load a previously saved tracing, click on the ""Load Trace"" button and choose the SWC file you want to load. The traced path will appear in the Napari viewer.

    pip install napari-trackastra
    ```

Notes:
- For tracking with an integer linear program (ILP, which is optional), follow the [installation instructions of the main `trackastra` package](https://github.com/weigertlab/trackastra/blob/main/README.md#installation).
- On Windows currently only supported for Python 3.10.

## Usage

- `trackastra` expects a timeseries of raw images and corresponding segmentations masks as input.
- We provide some demo data at `File > Open Sample > trackastra`.
- Tracked cells can be directly saved to [Cell Tracking Challenge format](https://celltrackingchallenge.net/datasets/).
- Results can be drag-and-dropped back into napari for inspection.

## Installation

You can install `napari-turing` via [pip] after downloading the content of

    pip install napari-turing


To install latest version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/leoguignard/napari-turing.git

## Troubleshooting

If the installation does not work just with the previous command, it might be useful to first install [napari] for example that way:

    conda install napari

## Creating a new model

To create your own model, you can use the template for models [here](src/napari_turing/Models/ModelTemplate.py).

Note that a bit of knowledge in Python is probably necessary and it might not be completely trivial at first but you'll manage :)

First you need to name the concentrations that you will use with the following [line](src/napari_turing/Models/ModelTemplate.py#L40):
```python
    _concentration_names = [""A"", ""I""]
```

Then, you need to declare its variables. For example you can create a parameter named `mu_a` the following way ([here in the code](src/napari_turing/Models/ModelTemplate.py#L53-L60)):
```python
    mu_a = ModelParameter(
        name=""mu_a"",  # Name of the parameter
        description=""Activator diffusion coefficient (10^-4)"",  # Description of the parameter for napari
        value=2.8,  # Initial and default value
        min=1,  # Minimum value the parameter can take
        max=5,  # Maximum value the parameter can take
        exponent=1e-4,  # All values given to this instance of the class will but multiplied by this value
    )
```

Then you need to list the parameters that are necessary to run the model (usually all the paramaters declared previously) and the parameters that you will allow the user to tune (for example, sometimes some of the parameters are co-dependent and there is no point in being able to tune both of them). That should be done the following way ([here in the code](src/napari_turing/Models/ModelTemplate.py#L86-89)):
```python
    # These are the parameters that are necessary to run the equations.
    _necessary_parameters = [tau, k, mu_a, mu_i]
    # These are the parameters that can be modified via napari
    _tunable_parameters = _necessary_parameters
```

If you want, you can specify what the method will return as a string, it will be displayed in the napari viewer ([here in the code](src/napari_turing/Models/ModelTemplate.py#L90-L98)):
```python
    # This function allows to display some information about the model
    # in napari
    def __str__(self) -> str:
        return (
            ""Equations (FitzHugh-Nagumo model):\n""
            ""  Concentration of Activator (a) and Inhibitor (i)\n""
            ""    - da/dt = mu_a * diffusion(a) + a - a^3 - i + k\n""
            ""    - tau * di/dt = mu_i * diffusion(i) + a - i""
        )
```

Now that the basics are declared, you will need to declare how to initialize your concentrations the following way ([here in the code](src/napari_turing/Models/ModelTemplate.py#L100-L116)):
```python
    # The following allows to reset the values of the concentrations.
    # The function takes the name of the concentration to initialize.
    # If no name is given or if it is None all the concentrations are
    # reinitialized.
    #
    # The reason why this function is useful is that some models 
    # require specific initialisations for them to work correctly
    # In the following example the concentrations are reintinalized
    # to a random value between -1 and 1.
    # This is the default behavior, so if you don't need to change
    # it you don't have to implement the function.
    def init_concentrations(self, C: Optional[str] = None) -> None:
        if C is None:
            for ci in self.concentration_names():
                self[ci] = np.random.random((self.size, self.size)) * 2 - 1
        else:
            self[C] = np.random.random((self.size, self.size)) * 2 - 1
```
In the previous example, the all concentrations are initialized the same way. If you need to have different initializations, you can do it the following way for example ([from the GrayScott model](src/napari_turing/Models/GrayScott.py#L68-L76)):
```python
    def init_concentrations(self, C: Optional[str] = None) -> None:
        if C == ""X"" or C is None:
            self[""X""] = np.ones((self.size, self.size))
        if C == ""Y"" or C is None:
            Y = np.zeros((self.size, self.size))
            nb_pos = 20
            pos = (np.random.random((2, nb_pos)) * self.size).astype(int)
            Y[pos[0], pos[1]] = 1
            self[""Y""] = Y
```
In this model, there are two concentrations, `X` and `Y` which are initialized differenty. Note that they can be accessed using `self[""X""]` or `self.X`.

Finally, you of course have to define the reaction equations and the diffusion equations. The way it is defined is with two functions, one for the reaction and one for the diffusion, that take as an input the name of the concentration to apply the function to and returns the new values. Then for each of your concentrations, their new values will be computed as followed:
```python
new_concentration = current_concentration + dt*(reaction + diffusion)
```

Here is an example for the reaction function ([here in the code](src/napari_turing/Models/ModelTemplate.py#L127-L136)):
```python 
    # This function defines the equations of the reactions.
    # It takes as an input which concentration to compute
    # (in this example we have to define how to compute A and I)
    def _reaction(self, c: str) -> np.ndarray:
        if c == ""A"":
            # Below is the reaction part of the equation (1)
            return self.A - self.A**3 - self.I + self.k 
        elif c == ""I"":
            # Below is the reaction part of the equation (2)
            return (self.A - self.I) / self.tau
```
Of course, if you have more concentrations, you will need to define more equations.

Here is an example for the reaction function ([here in the code](src/napari_turing/Models/ModelTemplate.py#L138-L166)):
```python
    # This function defines the equations of the diffusion.
    # It takes as an input which concentration to compute
    # (in this example we have to define how to compute A and I)
    # Here we compute the diffusion as follow:
    # A cell gives an equal fraction mu of its concentration to its neighbors
    # A cell recieves an equal fraction mu of concentration from its neighbors
    # Neighbors = (left, right, above, below)
    # In the case of oriented diffusion the amount recieved and given to the neighbors
    # is imbalanced according to the position of the neighbor.
    def _diffusion(self, c: str) -> np.ndarray:
        if c == ""A"":
            arr = self.A # Define the array of concentrations to diffuse for the reageant A
            mu = self.mu_a # Define the diffusion coefficient for the reageant A
        elif c == ""I"":
            arr = self.I # Define the array of concentrations to diffuse for the reageant I
            mu = self.mu_i # Define the diffusion coefficient for the reageant I
        
        # Computes what is recieved from neighboring cells
        from_cell = convolve(arr, self.kernel.value, mode=""constant"", cval=0)
        # Computes what is given to neighboring cells
        to_cell = self.nb_neighbs * arr

        # Computes the diffusion
        out = mu * (from_cell - to_cell) / (self.dx * self.dy)

        # In our case, the equation (2), for I specify that it has to be divided by tau
        if c == ""I"":
            out /= self.tau
        return out
```
The diffusion function is usually a standard one so it might not be necessary to overly change it.

You can find other model examples:
- [Brusselator](src/napari_turing/Models/Brusselator.py)
- [GrayScott](src/napari_turing/Models/GrayScott.py)
- [GameOfLife](src/napari_turing/Models/GameOfLife.py)

Once all that is done, let say you've saved your new model in the folder [Models](src/napari_turing/Models) under the name `NewModel.py` and the model class created is name `NewModel`. Then you need to declare you model in the [`_model_list.py`](src/napari_turing/Models/_model_list.py) file. To do so you need to add the following lines in the file:
```python
from enum import Enum
from .FitzHughNagumo import FitzHughNagumo
from .Brusselator import Brusselator
from .GrayScott import GrayScott
from .GameOfLife import GameOfLife
from .NewModel import NewModel ## THAT LINE HERE

class AvailableModels(Enum):
    FitzHughNagumo = FitzHughNagumo
    Brusselator = Brusselator
    GrayScott = GrayScott
    GameOfLife = GameOfLife
    NewModel = NewModel ## AND THAT OTHER LINE HERE
```

    * Or select it from `Plugins > Napari UI tracer widget`

2. Check the `Enable Qt event filter` checkbox:
    * Use `Ctrl/Cmd + Mouse button right click` to see the information available about any widget inside napari
    * An option to show objects documentation (object class docstring) can be used by checking the `Show object documentation` checkbox

3. Check the `Enable application events logging` checkbox:
    * A log like information with the events generated when interacting with the application will appear
    * Some configuration options are available:
        * `Stack depth`: Stack depth to show. Default to 20
        * `Allowed nested events`: How many sub-emit nesting levels to show (i.e. events that get triggered by other events). Default to 0

4. If you want to explore the related widget or event module source file, click the link in the output section of the plugin (the module file will open if you have a registered program to open such kind of file)

The napari plugin for UniSPAC [A Unified Segmentation framework for Proofreading and Annotation in Connectomics]. UniSPAC provides interactive 3D neuron segmentation. Neuron segmentation, proofreading and tracking can be done with just mouse clicks, which is much more efficient than existing tools.

## Requirements

A system with enough GPU memory and pytorch installed. The size of the GPU memory is related to the size of the vEM image that can be processed. For  `test_roi1_sub_z0-100.tiff` with a shape of 800x800x100, the recommended minimum GPU memory is 12GB.

## Installation

Step 1: install napari via pip:

```shell
pip install -U 'napari[all]'
```

Step 2: install `napari-UniSPAC`

```shell
git clone https://github.com/ddd9898/napari-UniSPAC.git
cd napari-UniSPAC
pip install -e .
```

Step 3: run napari:

```shell
napari
```

You can familiarise yourself with how UniSPAC's napari plugin operates by labeling  `test_roi1_sub_z0-100.tiff`, which is an example of Drosophila vEM images.

Congratulations :) &#127881;, now you can enjoy working with the plugin. 

## Unique about VASCilia :  
VASCilia saves all the intermediate results and the variables inside a pickle file while the user is using it in a very effiecint way. That allows a super fast uploading for the analysis if the user or their supervisor wants to keep working or review the analysis steps.  
*[Click me to learn how to upload a z-stack](https://youtu.be/Sxm_fsjoWL0)*  

## How to use VASCilia :  
*[Click me to see a video demo of the entire workflow](https://youtu.be/mNPJ1g0vEW8)*  

There are several buttons inside the blugin in the right hand side of Napari:

1. 'Open CZI Cochlea Files and Preprocess' button: read the CZI file.
2. 'Upload Processed CZI Stack' button: Incase you already have processed the stack, then just uplead your Analysis_state.pkl that usually has all the variables needed to upload your analysis
3. 'Trim Full Stack' button: this button allows you to choose only the slices of interest (has been automated in v_1_1_0)
4. ""Rotate' buttom: this button allows to rotate the stack to have proper analysis (has been automated in v_1_1_0)  
5. Segment with 3DBundleSeg: it is a two steps algorithm (2D detection + multi-object assignment algorithm across all slices) to produce robust 3D detection. 3DBundleSeg is the first instance segmentation model for stereocilia bundles in the literature. It is trained on P5 and P21 3D stacks (thousands of 2D instances) and it produces highly acccurate boundary delineation even in the most challenging datasets. Here are some examples:  

<p align=""center"">
  <strong>3DBundleSeg can tackle challenged cases</strong>  
  <br>
  <img src=""images/challenged_cases_gray.png"" width=""100%"">
</p>

<p align=""center"">
  <strong>Multi-object assignment algorithm to produce robust 3D detection</strong>  
  <br>
  <img src=""images/3DBundleSeg.png"" width=""100%"">
</p>


6. Delete Label 'button': delete the unwanted detection if it is near the boundary or for any other reason.
7. Calculate measurments 'button': calculate different measurments from the detected bundles and store them in csv file
8. Calculate Bundle Height 'button': compute the 3D distance from the highest point in the 3D detection of each bundle to it's base. This calculation will consider the sample resolution.
9. Perform Cell Clustering 'button': find the IHC, OHC1, OHC2, and OHC3 using either GMM, Kmeans or Deep Learning. Those layers will be added to the plugin to be used during the analysis. 
10. Compute Fluorescence Intensity 'button': produce plots and CSV files that has the accumelated intensity and mean intensity for the fluorescence signal.
11. Predict Region 'button': Predict whether the region is from the BASE, MIDDLE, or APEX region using a RESNET50 trained model. 
12. Compute Orientation: It computes the orientation using two strategies.

<p align=""center"">
  <strong>Bundle Height with top and bottom adjustable points in red and green, orientation with two points in magenta, and bundle ID in green</strong>  
  <br>
  <img src=""images/Bundles.png"" width=""50%"">
</p>

<p align=""center"">
  <strong>Cell type identification (IHC1 in yellow, OHC1 in cyan, OHC2 in green, and OHC3 in magenta)</strong>  
  <br>
  <img src=""images/clustering.png"" width=""50%"">
</p>

13. Training Section.

<p align=""center"">
  <strong>Training section</strong>  
  <br>
  <img src=""images/Training_section2.png"" width=""40%"">
</p>

The training section is for the research ear community incase their datasets are little different than ours then they can easily create their cround truth, train a new model and use it in the plugin
1. Create/Save Ground Truth 'button': this button will create a new layer to draw new ground truth and save them as variables inside the plugin
2. Generate Ground Truth Mask 'button': this button will save all the generated masks after finish annotating to a new folder. 
3. Display Stored Ground Truth 'button': this button will display the stored masks in the plugin.
4. Copy Segmentation Masks to Ground Truth 'button': this button helps in speeding up the annotation process by copying what our trained model is producing sothat the annotator will only correct the wrong part.
5. Move Ground Truth to Training Folder 'button': this button will move all the annotated ground truth to the training folder to start the training process. 
6. Check Training Data 'button': this button checks the training data whether they follow the format needed by the architecture. It checks whether there are training and valiation folders and it reads every single file to make sure it doesn't have redundant or no information. It gives warning messages incase it finds an issue.
7. Train New Model for 3DBundleSeg 'button': this button will start the training.

VASCilia also equipped with two more buttons for resetting (to facilitate transitions between analyzing several stacks) and also exit VASCilia.  
We are still working on the documentation, so this gihub will be continiuosly updated.

## Project Authors and Contacts

**Python Implementation of this repository:** Dr. Yasmin M. Kassim    
**Contact:** ykassim@ucsd.edu, ymkgz8@mail.missouri.edu  
Yasmin Kassim was responsible for the plugin design, fully implemented all functions in Python, wrote the manuscript,
proofread the ground truth data, created all figures, and established the GitHub repository and codebase.

**Stacks used in this study imaged by:** Dr. David Rosenberg   

**Height bundle ground truth analyses**: Samprita Das and Alma Renero.  

**StereoCilia Bundles Ground Truth**: 55 (P5 and P21) 3D stacks were manually annotated by Yasmin Kassim and five undergraduate students using the CVAT annotation tool. This is an extremely challenging process, as each 3D stack might have up to 60 bundles in a 3D setting, which could translate to around 1000 bundles in a 2D setting across all frames. The students involved in this effort are:  
**Samia Rahman, Ibraheem Al Shammaa, Samer Salim, Zhuoling Huang, and Kevin Huang**.

This dataset will be the first annotated dataset in the literature to 3D segment the stereocilia bundles and it will be published and available for the ear research community with the publication of this paper.

To be able to use interactive processing of meshes in napari, this plugin provides a bridge to the vedo library. It allows to transfer meshes between napari and vedo and to use the interactive processing capabilities of vedo in napari. 

## I/O

The plugin allows to export and import meshes and point layers. The following are supported:

| napari layer type | File Format | Import | Export | Features |
|:------------------:|:-----------:|:------:|:------:|:--------:|
| Surface | .vtp | ✓ | ✓ |  ✓ |
| Surface | .vtk | ✓ | ✓ |  ✗ |
| Surface | .obj | ✓ | ✓ |  ✗ |
| Surface | .stl | ✓ | ✓ |  ✗ |
| Surface | .ply | ✓ | ✓ |  ✗ |
| Points | .vtp | ✓ | ✓ |  ✓ |
| Points | .vtk | ✓ | ✓ |  ✗ |
| Points | .ply | ✓ | ✓ |  ✗ |
| Points | .obj | ✓ | ✓ |  ✗ |

## Interactive mesh cutting
To interactively cut meshes in the napari-vedo MeshCutter, install the plugin (see below) and open the plugin it from the napari plugins menu (`Plugins > Mesh Cutter (napari-vedo-bridge)`). 

To cut meshes you can use the following cutters:
- `PlaneCutter`: cuts a mesh with a plane
- `SphereCutter`: cuts a mesh with a sphere
- `BoxCutter`: cuts a mesh with a box

![](https://github.com/jo-mueller/napari-vedo-bridge/raw/main/docs/imgs/screenshot_box_cutter.png)

To send and get data into and from the plugin, you can:

- Retrieve the current mesh from napari (click `Retrieve mesh from napari`) - this imports the **currently selected mesh layer** from napari
- Load a mesh from file (click `Load mesh`)
- Send a mesh to napari (click `Send back to napari`) - this creates a new mesh layer in napari

## Mesh Processing Functions

The plugin also provides a set of mesh processing functions that can be used in napari. These functions are wrapped from the vedo library and provide various mesh processing capabilities. The following functions are available:

- `compute_normals`: Compute normals for the given mesh.
- `shrink`: Shrink the given mesh.
- `join`: Join the given meshes.
- `subdivide`: Subdivide the given mesh.
- `decimate`: Decimate the given mesh.
- `decimate_pro`: Decimate the given mesh using the Pro algorithm.
- `decimate_binned`: Decimate the given mesh using the Binned algorithm.
- `smooth`: Smooth the given mesh.
- `fill_holes`: Fill holes in the given mesh.
- `inside_points`: Get the points inside the given mesh.
- `extrude`: Extrude the given mesh.
- `split`: Split the given mesh into connected components.
- `extract_largest_region`: Extract the largest region from the given mesh.
- `binarize`: Binarize the given mesh.

## Pointcloud Processing Functions

The plugin also provides a set of pointcloud processing functions that can be used in napari. These functions are wrapped from the vedo library and provide various pointcloud processing capabilities. The following functions are available:

- `smooth_points`: Smooth the given points.
- `decimate_points`: Decimate the given points.
- `cluster_points`: Cluster the given points.
- `remove_outliers`: Remove outliers from the given points.
- `compute_normals_points`: Compute normals for the given points.
- `extract_largest_cluster`: Extract the largest cluster from the given points.

A simple plugin to detect vesicles in cells images.

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/plugins/index.html
-->

## Installation

You can install `napari-vesicles-segmentation` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-vesicles-segmentation



To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/alexisjapas/napari-vesicles-segmentation.git

## Usage
1. Open napari
2. Open your data
![usage-open-data](images/usage-open-data.png)
3. Launch the vesicles-segmentation plugin
4. Select the data you want to segment and set the parameters of the segmentation
![usage-setup](images/usage-setup.png)
    * **image**: The image to segment vesicles in. The image can be a 2D or 3D temporal stack of images.
    * **minimum vesicles size**: The minimum size of the vesicles to detect. Smaller detected vesicles are removed.
    * **membrane erosion**: The size of the disk radius used for eroding the cell. This is used to remove the external membrane. This parameter scales when downsizing the image, for more information see 'downsizing ratio' parameter.
    * **closing size**: The size of the disk radius used for closing the cell. This is used to fill holes in the cell. This parameter scales when downsizing the image, for more information see 'downsizing ratio' parameter.
    * **clip**: If set to zero, no standardization is performed. Otherwise, the standard deviation of the image is set to n_sigma * the standard deviation of the image, the image is standardized and its values are clipped to the range [-1, 1] in order to remove outliers. The higher the value of n_sigma, the less outliers are removed. This operation can lead to a better detection of the cell.
    * **downsampling ratio**: The downsampling ratio used for the downsampled image. This is used to speed up the computation. Downsampling the image have impact in reducing the resolution of erosion and closing e.g. for a downsize ratio of 2, setting the erosion size to 3 will result in an erosion size of 6.
    * **display cell detection**: If set to True, the cell detection is displayed in the viewer instead of the vesicle detection.
5. Click on the ""Segment"" button to start the segmentation. This can take few seconds or minutes depending on the size of the data. The result is added to the viewer as below.

Napari plugin for working with videos.

Relies on [pyvideoreader](https://pypi.org/project/pyvideoreader/) as a backend which itself uses [opencv](https://opencv.org) for reading videos.

## Installation
```shell
pip install napari[all] napari_video
```

## Usage
From a terminal:
```shell
napari video.avi
```

Or from within python:
```shell
import napari
from napari_video.napari_video import VideoReaderNP

path='video.mp4'
vr = VideoReaderNP(path)
with napari.gui_qt():
    viewer = napari.view_image(vr, name=path)
```

## Internals
`napari_video.napari_video.VideoReaderNP` exposes a video with a numpy-like interface, using opencv as a backend.

For instance, open a video:
```python
vr = VideoReaderNP('video.avi')
print(vr)
```
```
video.avi with 60932 frames of size (920, 912, 3) at 100.00 fps
```
Then

- `vr[100]` will return the 100th frame as a numpy array with shape `(902, 912, 3)`.
- `vr[100:200:10]` will return 10 frames evenly spaced between frame number 100 and 200 (shape `(10, 902, 912, 3)`).
- Note that by default, single-frame and slice indexing return 3D and 4D arrays, respectively. To consistently return 4D arrays, open the video with `remove_leading_singleton=False`. `vr[100]` will then return a `(1, 902, 912, 3)` array.
- We can also request specific ROIs and channels. For instance, `vr[100:200:10,100:400,800:850,1]` will return an array with shape `(10, 300, 50, 1)`.

Optimize image processing workflows in napari for segmentation quality

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-workflow-optimizer/raw/main/docs/napari-workflow-optimizer.gif)

## Usage

The starting point for workflow optimization is a workflow and some reference (""ground truth"") labels image. 
The label image can be a sparse annotation, which means only some objects and also parts of objets are annotated (see [hints](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-workflow-optimizer#optimization-hints)). 
These datasets should be ready. You can reproduce the following procedure by downloading an 
[examle raw image](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-workflow-optimizer/blob/main/demo/membranes_2d.tif) (derived from the 
[scikit-image cells3d example data set](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.data.html#skimage.data.cells3d)) and a corresponding 
[sparse annotation label image](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-workflow-optimizer/blob/main/demo/membranes_2d_sparse_labels.tif).
For reproducing the following procedure, also follow the [installation instructions](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-workflow-optimizer#optimization-hints) below.
The whole procedure is [also shown in this video](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-workflow-optimizer/raw/main/docs/napari-workflow-optimizer.mp4), an extended version of the trailer above.

### Step 0: Loading data and setting up the workflow

Load the ""membranes_2d.tif"" data set, e.g. by drag&drop on napari and start the Assistant from the `Tools > Utilities > Assistant (clEsperanto)` menu.

![](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-workflow-optimizer/raw/main/docs/screenshot1_start_raw.png)

Click the `Label` button and select as operation ""Seeded watershed using local minima as seeds and an intensity threshold (nsbatwm)"".

![](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-workflow-optimizer/raw/main/docs/screenshot2_labeled_beginning.png)

Draw an annotation in a new labels layer or load the example spare annotation ""membranes_2d_sparse_labels.tif"". 

![](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-workflow-optimizer/raw/main/docs/screenshot4_loaded_manual_annotation.png)

In case the image is not displayed as label image, convert it to a label image by right-clicking on the entry in the layers list:

![](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-workflow-optimizer/raw/main/docs/screenshot3_load_manual_annotation.png)

### Step 1: The Workflow Optimizer

Start the Workflow Optimizer from the `Tools > Utilities > Workflow optimizer (Labels)` menu. 
Configure the target layer, showing the label image that should be optimized.
Select the manual annotation as reference layer for the optimization. 
Consider increasing the number of iterations. This number depends on your segmenation problem. 
In the present example, 100 iterations should be enough.

![](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-workflow-optimizer/raw/main/docs/screenshot5_start_optimization.png)

The optimizer will plot quality over the number of iterations to show the progress of optimization. 
To determine the quality, the optimizer will measure the maximum overlap ([Jaccard index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index)) 
of any labeled object over the manually annotated objects and calculate the mean of this value over all annotated objects.
After a moment, optimization will finish and update the labeled image. 
If your starting point for the optimization was already good, the result may now look better than before.

![](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-workflow-optimizer/raw/main/docs/screenshot6_finished_optimization.png)

### Step 2: Manual parameter space plotting

In case the result is not perfect yet (as the fringed segmentation above suggests), consider manual plotting of the 
individual parameters and their relation to segmentation quality to get an idea about the surrounding parameter space.
Therefore, click the `Plot` button next to one of the workflow parameters.
Select the range in which the labeling quality should be determined (green arrows). In our example, the optimizer was setting the parameter to 2.34. 
Thus, to demonstrate the procedure we plot the parameter space beween 0 and 10. 
The quality plotted over this parameter obviously has a local maxium at 2.34, which was detected by the optimizer.
However, it also has another local maxium at 8 and actually a plateau in the quality plot (orange arrows).

![](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-workflow-optimizer/raw/main/docs/screenshot7_parameter_quality_plot.png)

For further optimization, we re-configure the algorithm and set a new starting point for optimization of the parameter to 8.
Afterwards, we restart the optimization. It will then optimize the settings again from the new starting point.

![](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-workflow-optimizer/raw/main/docs/screenshot8_start_optimization_again.png)

After another moment, optimization will finish again, potentially leading to an even better result.

![](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-workflow-optimizer/raw/main/docs/screenshot9_finished_optimization_again.png)

### Step 3: Visualization of results

Make sure the segmentation has high quality by inspecting the result visually. Use the `contour` setting of the labels layer
and hide/show the outlines of the labeled layer:

![](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-workflow-optimizer/raw/main/docs/screenshot10_contours_on.png)

![](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-workflow-optimizer/raw/main/docs/screenshot11_contours_off.jpg)

### Optimization Hints

The Workflow Optimizer uses the [Nelder-Mead simplex method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelder%E2%80%93Mead_method)
for optimizing parameters. This algorithm varies individual parameters and makes steps in the parameter space ideally following a gradient 
to a local optimum. Hence, this algorithm may not be capable of determining a global optimum in parameter space. 
Parameter optimization is no magic. If it does not immediately work on your data, plot the parameters as introduced in Step 2 
and identify parameters with a clear gradient and those with many local maxima. 
Consider optimizing the parameters with many local maxima manually and de-selecting their checkboxes for the optimization.
The optimizer will then only optimize the parameters showing the clear gradient. 
Repeat these steps a couple of times to get a feeling for your parameter space. 

Furthermore, parameter optimization works well if
* the initial settings are close to a good segmentation,
* a small number of parameters (a short workflow) are optimized,
* the reference annotation is prepared carefully and
* the dataset is small. Consider using a small representative crop in case of bigger datasets.

### Workflow optimization scripting

For optimizing workflows from within a jupyter notebook, check out our [example notebook for optimization using spare labels](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-workflow-optimizer/blob/main/demo/sparse_label_image_optimizer.ipynb). 
The examples are more flexible than the graphical user interface and allow for example [optimizing intensity images](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-workflow-optimizer/blob/main/demo/intensity_image_optimizer.ipynb)
and [binary images](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-workflow-optimizer/blob/main/demo/binary_image_optimizer.ipynb).
The membrane segmentation workflow optimization similar to the one shown above is also available as [jupyter notebook](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-workflow-optimizer/blob/main/demo/membrane_segmentation.ipynb).

### Known issues

If you change the workflow architecture after the optimizer window was opened, please re-open it
to select the parameters that should be optimized. Changing parameters is ok and re-opening is not necessary.

The purpose of this repository is to provide a template for a napari plugin that can be used as a starting point for the napari software development workshop 2023.
It should help you to see the basics of building documentation, testing, and continuous integration for a napari plugin.

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.
The cookiecutter plugin is also a great jumping off point for your own plugin development.

A plugin to read whole-slide images within [napari].

---

## Installation via pip

You can install `napari-wsi` via [pip]:

```bash
pip install ""napari-wsi[all]>=1.0""
```

This automatically installs all optional backends, as a shortcut for:

```bash
pip install ""napari-wsi[openslide,rasterio,wsidicom]>=1.0""
```

In addition, to be able to read images using the `openslide` backend, it is
required to install the OpenSlide library itself, for example by installing the
[openslide-bin] python package (also via [pip]).

## Installation via conda

You can also install `napari-wsi` via [conda]:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge ""napari-wsi>=1.0""
```

This already installs all optional dependencies, including OpenSlide.

# Description

This [napari] plugin provides a widget for reading various whole-slide image
formats using a common [zarr] store inteface, based on the libraries
[openslide], [rasterio], and [wsidicom].

# Quickstart

After installation, open the `Plugins` menu in the viewer and select
`WSI Reader` to open the widget. Then select a `Backend` to use, select a `Path`
to open, and click `Load`.

![The napari viewer displaying a sample image.](./resources/sample_data.jpg)

If `sRGB` is selected in the `Color Space` menu and an ICC profile is attached
to the given image, a transformation to this color space will be applied when
the image data is read. Otherwise, the raw RGB image data will be displayed.

This plugin can also be used to open image files via drag and drop into the
viewer window. The file suffixes '.bif', '.ndpi', '.scn', '.svs' are registered
with the `openslide` backend, while the suffixes '.tif' and '.tiff' are
registered with the `rasterio` backend. These files can also be opened directly
from the command line or from a python script:

```bash
napari CMU-1.svs
```

```python
from napari import Viewer

viewer = Viewer()
viewer.open(""CMU-1.svs"", plugin=""napari-wsi"")
```

It is also possible to use the different backend classes directly, in which case
some more features are available, for example:

```python
from napari import Viewer
from napari_wsi.backends.openslide import OpenSlideStore

viewer = Viewer()

# Display the image in the sRGB color space and a physical coordinate system:
store = OpenSlideStore(""CMU-1.svs"", color_space=""sRGB"")
(layer,) = store.to_viewer(viewer, spatial_transform=True)
assert layer.metadata[""color_space""] == ""sRGB""

# Display a scale bar to indicate milli- or micrometers, depending on the zoom level:
viewer.scale_bar.visible = True
viewer.scale_bar.colored = True
```

```python
from napari import Viewer
from napari_wsi.backends.wsidicom import WSIDicomStore
from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
from wsidicom import WsiDicomWebClient

viewer = Viewer()
client = WsiDicomWebClient.create_client(""..."", auth=HTTPBasicAuth(""..."", ""...""))
store = WSIDicomStore(client=client, study_uid=""..."", series_uids=""..."")
store.to_viewer(viewer)
```

The sample images used above are part of the OpenSlide test data (see [Aperio]
and [DICOM]).

# Known Issues & Other Notes

- This plugin is prototype research software and there may be **breaking
  changes** with each release of the plugin, which is also the case for current
  releases of the [napari] viewer itself.
- The `wsidicom` backend supports loading annotations together with the image
  data. However, this may take several minutes, depending on the number and
  complexity of the annotations. When loading more than a few thousand polygon
  annotations, make sure that the experimental ""[triangles] speedup"" setting is
  enabled.

Note: This plugin is work-in-progress. Check out the [github issues](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-xgboost/issues) to see what's currently being worked on.

## Usage

Load an example image into napari. Add a Labels layer by clicking on this button:

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-xgboost/raw/main/docs/images/img.png)

Then, draw a sparse annotation on the image. Try to draw thin lines on background and foreground, e.g. like this:

![img_1.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-xgboost/raw/main/docs/images/img_1.png)

Then click the menu `Layers > Segment > Train Pixel Classifier (XGBoost)`.

![img_2.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/napari-xgboost/raw/main/docs/images/img_2.png)

In the dialog, select the original image and the labels layer. Also enter a filename where the model should be saved.

A simple plugin for 3d+t files that visualizes z-planes in 3 colors for depth information. 

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/stable/plugins/index.html
-->

This plugin can colorize and provide depth information on single-channel 3D+t files. The color coding enhances the visibility of structures and the detection/annotations of dynamic events. 

<p align=""middle"">
  <img src=""https://github.com/maihanhoang/napari-zplane-depth-colorizer/raw/main/assets/plugin_demo.gif"" width=""100%"" />
</p>

Identifying dynamic events such as cellular divisions can be challenging in 3D time-lapses of developing tissues such as organoids or embryos. Visualizing and annotating such events in dense 3D stacks obtained by light-sheet or two-photon microscopy where nuclei are almost in contact is especially challenging. With this visualization method, the tissue section can be ""augmented"" in 3D by visualizing the surrounding tissue layers in different colors. 

This plugin is for bioimaging researchers who need to annotate events in time lapses of dense tissues. It supports 3D+t stacks in the TZYX format. 

## Installation

You can install `napari-zplane-depth-colorizer` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-zplane-depth-colorizer

To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/maihanhoang/napari-zplane-depth-colorizer.git

## Quick Start
A sample file can be found at `src/napari_zplane_depth_colorizer/data/3D+t.tif`

1. Open a 3D+t tif in napari, make sure it is in TZYX format
2. If it's a 4D file, it will automatically appear in the drop-down menu of *Input*
3. Use default parameters for *Z-Projection Type* and *Depth Range*
4. Click *Merge to RGB*
5. Result will appear in the viewer and in *Output*
6. To save, select the colored stack in *Output*, select saving format (*Save as*), and click *Save RGB*

## Parameters
There are two depth augmentation parameters for each RGB color channel: Z-Projection Type and Depth Range. Depth Range indicates which and how many z-planes are projected for a channel. The Z-Projection Type specifies which type of projection is applied. The **How it works** section below might help you understand the parameters better.

### Z-Projection Types 
The Z-projection types are the same ones found in [Fiji](https://imagej.net/software/fiji/), except for ""Raw. ""Raw is the original stack without any projection.

### Depth Range
- Depth Range is a range and consists of two numbers [range_start, range_end]. The range is inclusive and requires range_start <= range_end. 

- Exception if Z-Projection Type is ""Raw"" since no z-projection is applied. The Depth Range for Raw can either be empty (equals 0 then) or a single number. 

- The Depth Range indicates the z-planes relative to the reference plane that are projected and then assigned to a color channel. The reference plane is the plane for which the color merging is currently computed.

- In the illustration below, the current reference plane is the 4. plane (indicated by the color wheel in the right stack). A Depth Range of [-3, -1] for the red channel denotes the first three planes above the reference plane. Similarly, a Depth Range of [1, 2] for the blue channel indicates the first two planes below the reference plane. Negative numbers are for the planes above, and positive numbers are for ones below the reference plane. 0 is the same as the reference plane (the green plane in the illustration).

</p>


## How it works
### Creating a colored image from a single-channel stack

To colorize a single-channel stack, multiple z-planes are assigned to different color (RGB) channels and then overlaid to create a composite colored image. For a simple z-stack with three planes, the 1. plane is assigned to red, the 2. to green, and the 3. plane to blue. They are overlaid/merged to create a single composite RGB-color plane. In the composite image, multiple z-planes are displayed simultaneously, with the colors providing the depth information. In this example, red indicates that cells are in the upper, while blue cells are in the deeper z-planes. The colors make it easier to detect and track cells that move or split in the z-direction.  


<!---------
In other words, instead of having multiple channels from different fluorescence labels, the z-planes are treated as different channels and then merged to create a composite image.

<p align=""middle"">
  <img src=""https://github.com/maihanhoang/napari-zplane-depth-colorizer/raw/main/assets/3_plane_stack.gif"" width=""100%"" />
</p>

On the left is an image of a single plane of an organoid and on the right is the colorized plane. To create the colors, the same plane was overlaid with the direct upper and lower plane, as shown in the illustration above. 
<p align=""middle"">
  <img src=""https://github.com/maihanhoang/napari-zplane-depth-colorizer/raw/main/assets/img_gray.png"" width=""49%"" />
  <img src=""https://github.com/maihanhoang/napari-zplane-depth-colorizer/raw/main/assets/img_color.png"" width=""49%"" /> 
</p>

### Colorizing the entire stack
To obtain a colorized stack of the same size as the original stack, the merging is applied for each z-plane. At the boundaries, the colors can differ, as there are no further z-planes to assign to a color channel. For example, the first plane in the colorized stack consists of an overlay of only two planes in green and blue, which results in a blue/green/cyan-colored image. Similarly, the last plane of the colorized stack is a red/green/yellowish image since it lacks a blue channel.    

<p align=""middle"">
  <img src=""https://github.com/maihanhoang/napari-zplane-depth-colorizer/raw/main/assets/entire_stack.gif"" width=""100%"" />
</p>

### Varying the depth with z-projections
It is also possible to vary the depth and overlay more than three planes. To do this, a z-projection is applied to the planes before assigning them to a color and merging. In the illustration below, a different number of planes is assigned to each color. Before merging the three RGB color channels, a z-projection is applied if more than one plane is assigned to a color. In the illustration below, three planes are selected for the red color channel. A z-projection (e.g. average intensity) is applied to generate a single plane for the red channel. This z-projected plane is merged with the raw, green plane and the z-projected plane of the blue channel. 


<p align=""middle"">
  <img src=""https://github.com/maihanhoang/napari-zplane-depth-colorizer/raw/main/assets/entire_stack_zproj.jpg"" width=""100%"" />

For the entire stack:

  <img src=""https://github.com/maihanhoang/napari-zplane-depth-colorizer/raw/main/assets/entire_stack_zproj.gif"" width=""100%"" />
</p>

On the left is an image of a single plane of an organoid, and on the right is the colorized plane. To create the colors, the same plane was overlaid with three upper and two lower z-planes, as shown in the illustration above.

Plugin adapted from Ultralytics to bring YOLOv5 into Napari. 

Training and detection can be done using the GUI. Training dataset must be prepared prior to using this plugin. Further development will allow users to use Napari to prepare the dataset. Follow instructions stated on [Ultralytics Github](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) to prepare the dataset.

The plugin includes 3 pre-trained networks that are able to identify mitosis stages or apoptosis on soSPIM images. More details can be found on the [pre-print](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.03.26.437121v1.full).

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/plugins/stable/index.html
-->

![alt text](https://github.com/rdemets/napari-yolov5/blob/main/src/napari_yolov5/resources/Readme/1.jpg?raw=true)


***For `Training` :***

Data preparation should be done following [Ultralytics'](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5) instructions.

Select the size of the network, the number of epochs, the number of images per batch to load on the GPU, the size of the images (must be a stride of 32), and the name of the network.

![alt text](https://github.com/rdemets/napari-yolov5/blob/main/src/napari_yolov5/resources/Readme/2.jpg?raw=true)

An example of the YAML config file is provided in `src/napari_yolov5/resources` folder.

![alt text](https://github.com/rdemets/napari-yolov5/blob/main/src/napari_yolov5/resources/Readme/3.jpg?raw=true)


Progress can be seen on the Terminal or on the right-hand side of the viewer.

![alt text](https://github.com/rdemets/napari-yolov5/blob/main/src/napari_yolov5/resources/Readme/4.jpg?raw=true)


***For `Detection` :***

It is possible to perform the detection on a single layer chosen in the list, all the layers opened, or by giving a folder path. For folder detection, all the images will be loaded as a single stack.

![alt text](https://github.com/rdemets/napari-yolov5/blob/main/src/napari_yolov5/resources/Readme/5.jpg?raw=true)

Nucleus size of the prediction layer has te be filled to resize the image to the training dataset. Nucleus size of the training dataset will be asked in case of a custom network.

Confidence threshold defines the minimum value for a detected object to be considered positive. 
iou nms threshold (intersection-over-union non-max-suppression) defines the overlapping area of two boxes as a single object. Only the box with the maximum confidence is kept.
Progress can be seen on the Terminal.

![alt text](https://github.com/rdemets/napari-yolov5/blob/main/src/napari_yolov5/resources/Readme/6.jpg?raw=true)

Few options allow for modification on how the boxes are being displayed (default : box + class + confidence score ; box + class ; box only) and if the box coordinates and the image overlay will be exported.
Post-processing option will perform a simple 3D assignment based on 3D connected component analysis. A median filter (1x1x3 XYZ) is applied prior to the assignment. 
The centroid of each object is then saved into a new point layer as a 3D point with a random color for each class. 

![alt text](https://github.com/rdemets/napari-yolov5/blob/main/src/napari_yolov5/resources/Readme/7.jpg?raw=true)

The localisation of each centroid is saved and the path is shown in the Terminal at the end of the detection. It is also possible now to define the export folder.

## ZELDA: a 3D Image Segmentation and Parent-Child relation plugin for microscopy image analysis in napari
#### Authors: Rocco D'Antuono, Giuseppina Pisignano

###### Article: Front. Comput. Sci., 04 January 2022 | https://doi.org/10.3389/fcomp.2021.796117

###### Examples of 2D and 3D data sets: [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5651284](https://zenodo.org/record/5651284#.YYgn_WDP2Ch)
----------------------------------

## What you can do with ZELDA plugin for napari
The plugin can be used to analyze 2D/3D image data sets.  
Multidimensional images (each channel corresponding to a napari layer) can be used to:

1. Segment objects such as cells and organelles in 2D/3D.

2. Segment two populations in 2D/3D (e.g. cells and organelles, nuclei and nuclear spots, tissue structures and cells) establishing the ""Parent-Child"" relation: count how many mitochondria are contained in each cell, how many spots localize in every nucleus, how many cells are within a tissue compartment.

  Example: cell cytoplasms (parent objects) and mitochondria (child objects)

  ------ | ------| -----
  ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RoccoDAnt/napari-zelda/main/docs/2D-AF488_parents.png) <br> **Parent cell cytoplasms** | ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RoccoDAnt/napari-zelda/main/docs/2D-MT_children.png) <br> **Children mitochondria**| ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RoccoDAnt/napari-zelda/main/docs/2D-MT_childrenbyParent.png) <br> **Children labelled by Parents**

The images shown above are available in the [**docs**](https://github.com/RoccoDAnt/napari-zelda/tree/main/docs) folder of this repository and were segmented using ZELDA with the following parameters:


   | **Parent objects** | **GB: sigma=2.0-> Th_parents=60.0-> DistMap-> Maxima: min_dist=10** |
   | -----|  ----|
   | **Children objects** | **GB: sigma=0.3-> Th_children=450.0 -> DistMap-> Maxima: min_dist=2**|

For small monitors it may be convenient to float the protocol panel

    ------ | ------|

4. Customize an image analysis workflow in graphical mode (no scripting knowledge required).

    | ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RoccoDAnt/napari-zelda/main/docs/CustomProtocol.png) <br> **Custom image analysis workflow** |
    ------ |

5. Import and Export Protocols (image analysis workflows) in graphical mode (share with the community!).

2. Open `Plugins` → `Normalize and Denoise`
3. Select your bright-field image from the **BF** dropdown
4. Click **""Normalize + Denoise""**

#### What it does
- **Color Normalization**: Adjusts colors against an internal reference to standardize appearance across different images/scanners
- **Denoising**: Removes noise while preserving important cellular structures
- **Output**: Creates a new layer named `{original_name}_denoised`

---

### Segment

**Purpose**: Detects and segments individual cell nuclei using Cellpose.

#### Usage
1. Load a nuclear staining image (DAPI) into napari
2. Open `Plugins` → `Segment`
3. Select your nuclear image from the **DAPI** dropdown
4. Optionally adjust:
   - **GPU**: Enable for faster processing
   - **Model**: Choose Cellpose model (`cyto3` default)
5. Click **""Segment Nuclei""**

#### What it does
- **Segmentation**: Uses Cellpose to identify individual nuclei
- **Creates 3 new layers**:
  - `{name}_masks`: Segmentation masks
  - `{name}_centroids`: Center points of each detected cell
  - `{name}_bboxes`: Bounding boxes around each cell

---

### Segment + Classify

**Purpose**: Complete pipeline that segments nuclei AND classifies cell types in multi-channel images.

#### Usage
1. Load a **4-channel image** into napari as separate layers:
   - **DAPI**: Nuclear staining
   - **Tuj1**: β-III-tubulin
   - **RFP**: Red fluorescent protein marker
   - **BF**: Bright-field
2. Open `Plugins` → `Segment and Classify`
3. Select each channel from the respective dropdowns
4. Choose **Reuse cached**:
   - **True**: Reuse previous segmentation (faster) from the segment widget
   - **False**: Perform fresh segmentation
5. Click **""Segment + Classify""**

#### What it does
1. **Segmentation**: Does segmentation same as the segment widget above
2. **Feature extraction**: Uses a Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to extract features
3. **Classification**: Nearest-centroid classifier assigns cell types

#### Output
Creates colored bounding box layers for each detected cell type:
- **🟣 Astrocytes** (magenta boxes)
- **⚫ Dead Cells** (gray boxes)
- **🔵 Neurons** (cyan boxes)
- **🟢 OPCs** (lime boxes)

Layer names show counts: `{count}_{cell_type}s` (e.g., `23_Neurons`)

## Automated organelle segmentation, tracking, and hierarchical feature extraction in 2D/3D live-cell microscopy

<img src=""https://github.com/aelefebv/nellie/assets/26515909/96b7a113-be60-4028-bcd9-b444bdb943f6"" width=""200px"" align=""left"" /> *arXiv* 

  [Preprint Link](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13214) | [Cite](#reference)

**Abstract:** The analysis of dynamic organelles remains a formidable challenge, though key to understanding biological processes. We introduce Nellie, an automated and unbiased pipeline for segmentation, tracking, and feature extraction of diverse intracellular structures. Nellie adapts to image metadata, eliminating user input. Nellie’s preprocessing pipeline enhances structural contrast on multiple intracellular scales allowing for robust hierarchical segmentation of sub-organellar regions. Internal motion capture markers are generated and tracked via a radius-adaptive pattern matching scheme, and used as guides for sub-voxel flow interpolation. Nellie extracts a plethora of features at multiple hierarchical levels for deep and customizable analysis. Nellie features a Napari-based GUI that allows for code-free operation and visualization, while its modular open-source codebase invites customization by experienced users. 

**Nellie's pipeline and Napari plugin are both very much in early stages,** therefore [I highly encourage any and all feedback](#getting-help).

## Installation (~ 1 minute)

**Notes:** 
- It is recommended (but usually not required) to [create a new environment](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html) for Nellie to avoid conflicts with other packages.
- May take several minutes to install.
- Choose one of the following methods, and only one!
- If you do not already have Python 3.9 or higher installed, download it via the [python website]([url](https://www.python.org/downloads/)).

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/50b1cd4b-6df7-4f19-8db3-4dcc03388513


### Option 1. Via Napari plugin manager:
If not already installed, install Napari: https://napari.org/stable/tutorials/fundamentals/installation

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d44abe5-f575-4bd4-962a-2c102faf737c


1. Open Napari
2. Go to ```Plugins > Install/Uninstall Plugins...```
3. Search for Nellie and click ```Install```
4. Make sure Nellie is updated to the latest version.
5. Restart Napari.
### Option 2. Via PIP:


https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b63df093-e3e1-49cb-925b-7efce36b9015


```bash
python3 -m pip install nellie
```
#### Option 2a for NVIDIA GPU acceleration, optional (Windows, Linux):
To use GPU acceleration via NVIDIA GPUs, you also need to install cupy:
```bash
pip install cupy-cudaXXx
```
- replace ```cupy-cudaXXx``` with the [appropriate version](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html#installing-cupy) for your CUDA version.
  - i.e. ```cupy-cuda11x``` for CUDA 11.x or ```cupy-cuda12x``` for CUDA 12.x
- if you don't have CUDA installed, [go here](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/install.html).
- Mac Metal GPU-acceleration coming... eventually.

## Usage
The sample dataset shown below is in the repo if you want to play around without, and can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/aelefebv/nellie/tree/main/sample_data).

### General data preparation
- It is strongly recommended to have your data in a parsable format, such as .ome.tif, .nd2, or other raw data files from microscopes.
  - Importing into ImageJ/FIJI and saving via BioFormats with the proper image dimensions should do the trick.
  - If the metadata cannot be parsed, you will have to manually enter it.
- It is also recommended to crop your image as much as possible to reduce processing time and memory usage. But really, unless you have massive lightsheet data, it should be pretty fast (seconds to minutes on a typical modern desktop computer).

### 3D + Timeseries dataset

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/531f76ee-f58e-4058-b5dc-4fdf09af3660

### 3D (no Timeseries) dataset

### Running Nellie's processing pipeline
1. Start Napari (open a Terminal and type napari)
    ```bash
    napari
    ```
2. Go to 
```Plugins > Nellie (nellie)``` then to the ```File select``` tab.
3. Click ```Select File``` of ```Select Folder``` to select your image(s).
   - If the metadata boxes do not fill in automatically and turn red, this means Nellie did not detect that metadata portion from your image, and you must manually enter it or reformat your image and try again.
     - The metadata slot will appear green if it is in the correct format.
   - *Note, if you are batch processing, the metadata must be the same for all images if any of them are in an incorrect format (this will be fixed eventually). If they are different, but all pass validation, then it will process fine.
   - You can preview your image via the ```Open preview``` button once the metadata is filled in to ensure it looks correct.
   - From this tab, you can also choose what time points and channel you want to analyze, if your file contains more than one slice in those dimensions.
4. Click the ```Process``` tab.
5. You can run the full pipeline with ```Run Nellie```, or run individual steps below.
    - Steps can only be run once its previous step has been run.
    - Likewise, visualizations in the ```Visualization``` tab can only be opened once its respective step has been run.
6. All intermediate files and output csvs will be saved to ```[image_directory]/nellie_output/```, which can be accessed via the ```Open output directory``` button.
   - A separate .csv is created for each level of the organellar hierarchy.
7. Once features have been exported, Nellie will automatically detect this, and allow analysis via the ```Analyze``` tab.
   - Analysis at this point is optional, but can be helpful for visualizing, and selectively exporting data.

### Using Nellie's visualization plugin
1. Follow the previous processing steps, you only need to do this once per file as long as you don't move or delete the files.
2. Open the ```Visualization``` tab
3. Select a visualization from the list.
   1. ```Raw```: Visualize the raw data for the processed channel.
   2. ```Preprocessed```: Visualize the contrast-enhanced data.
   3. ```Segmentation```: Visualize the organelle and branch instance segmentation masks.
   4. ```Mocap Markers```: Visualize the mocap markers used for waypoints.
   5. ```Reassigned Labels```: Visualize the organelle and branch instance segmentation masks where voxels are reassigned based on the first timepoint.
4. To visualize tracks, open and select one of the segmentation layers.
5. To visualize all tracks of all organelles/branches, click the ```Visualize all frame labels' tracks``` button.
6. To visualize all tracks of a specific organelle/branch:
   1. Click on the layer, and use the eyedropper tool at the top to select an organelle/branch to track.
   2. Click the ```Visualize selected label's tracks```.

### Using Nellie's analysis plugin
1. Follow the previous processing steps, you only need to do this once per file as long as you don't move or delete the files.
2. Open the ```Analyze``` tab, select the hierarchy level you want to visualize from the dropdown.
3. Select the level-specific feature you want to visualize from the new dropdown.
4. A histogram of all the data will be displayed.
   - This histogram can be directly exported via the ```Save graph``` button. A .png will be saved to ```[image_directory]/nellie_output/graphs/``` with the current datetime.
   - The values of the histogram can be exported via the ```Export graph data``` button. A .csv will be saved to ```[image_directory]/nellie_output/graphs/``` with the current datetime.
   - The histogram's x-axis can be viewed in log10 scale via the ```Log scale``` checkbox.
   - By default, the histogram shows lines at the mean +/- 1 standard deviation. This can instead be switched to median and quartiles via the ```Median view``` checkbox.
5. Press the ```Overlay mask``` button to colormap the organelle mask based on your selected feature.
   - Once overlaid, toggle the ```Timepoint data``` checkbox to allow you to select a specific timepoint to visualize via the slider.

## Other features
- Nellie's plugin offers an ```Easy screenshot``` feature:
  - Press the button under ```Easy screenshot``` or hit Ctrl/Cmd-Shift-E after clicking your image.
  - The .png will be saved to ```[image_directory]/nellie_output/screenshots/``` with the current datetime.

## Basic usage example

<img src=""https://github.com/beanli161514/neurofly/raw/main/assets/pipeline.png"" width=""640"">

NeuroFly packaged 4 napari plugins for image browsing, image segmentation, and data annotation.

<img src=""https://github.com/beanli161514/neurofly/raw/main/assets/menu.png"" width=""320"">

### Segmentation

NeuroFly supports whole brain image saved in hierarchical data structures(ims, h5, and zarr) in [Imaris File Format](https://imaris.oxinst.com/support/imaris-file-format) and small image volumes saved in single-channel tiff format. Here we use a mouse brain in our dataset named z002.zarr.zip as example.

This brain is sparsely labeled, which means only a tiny puny part of neurons are lighted and imaged. To extract these foreground singals, you can use the provided command line interface 'seg'. We provide a default weight trained on images captured by VISoR and fMOST.
```
seg -i z002.zarr.zip -vis -d z002.db
```
or use the graphical interface

<img align src=""https://github.com/beanli161514/neurofly/raw/main/assets/neuron_seger.png"" width=""200"">


This process may take about 10 hours depending on your you hardware configuration. When finished, you should see the extracted segments and a database file named z002.db in your working dictionary.

<img align src=""https://github.com/beanli161514/neurofly/raw/main/assets/segmentation.gif"" width=""640"">


### Manual connection and proofreading

Launch annotation tool from napari menu, Plugin -> neurofly -> Segs Annotator

#### Load data
Load image file (z002.zarr.zip) and database file (z002.db), then click **refresh panorama** button to show the panorama view.

<img src=""https://github.com/beanli161514/neurofly/raw/main/assets/overall.png"" width=""600"">


#### Select one node as start point of annotation
In panorama mode, you can easily identify sparse, bright signals that are promising for reconstruction. The silde bars 'short segs filter', 'length thres', and 'point size' can be adjusted to hide noise and short segments. 

If you can clearly identify foreground segments, click on one of the conspicuous segments to select it as start point of annotation. Once selected, the id of picked node will be displayed at **node selection**. Then click 'switch mode' to switch to labeling mode, and the tasks will be generated automatically.


#### Task generation
Given a selected node, task generator analyses its connected component and extract all unchecked terminal nodes. The tasks are designed very simple: Connect the center node with the surrounding nodes if there should be an edge. The criterion is whether the edge aligns well with the imaged neuron fibers.

<img src=""https://github.com/beanli161514/neurofly/raw/main/assets/task_generation.png"" width=""480"">


#### Node operations
<img src=""https://github.com/beanli161514/neurofly/raw/main/assets/labeling_mode.png"" width=""480"">

In each task, a center node and nearby segments are rendered, you can add/remove nodes and edges to get a reasonable local structure.


Left click on nodes to add/remove an edge between it and the center node

### A [napari](https://napari.org/stable/) plugin implementing [`infer-subc`](https://github.com/ndcn/infer-subc) segmentation workflows. 
See [`infer-subc`](https://github.com/ndcn/infer-subc) for more information.

# FRAMEWORK, RESOURCES & CONTRIBUTIONS
 
## Forked from Allen Institute for Cell Science project
The Allen Cell & Structure Segmenter plugin for napari, from which this projects is forked, provides an intuitive graphical user interface to access the powerful segmentation capabilities of an open source 3D segmentation software package developed and maintained by the Allen Institute for Cell Science (classic workflows only with v1.0). ​[The Allen Cell & Structure Segmenter](https://allencell.org/segmenter) is a Python-based open source toolkit developed at the Allen Institute for Cell Science for 3D segmentation of intracellular structures in fluorescence microscope images. This toolkit brings together classic image segmentation and iterative deep learning workflows first to generate initial high-quality 3D intracellular structure segmentations and then to easily curate these results to generate the ground truths for building robust and accurate deep learning models. The toolkit takes advantage of the high replicate 3D live cell image data collected at the Allen Institute for Cell Science of over 30 endogenous fluorescently tagged human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC) lines. Each cell line represents a different intracellular structure with one or more distinct localization patterns within undifferentiated hiPS cells and hiPSC-derived cardiomyocytes.

More details about Segmenter can be found at https://allencell.org/segmenter

A napari plugin for processing serial-FIB-SEM data.

Powered by [chafer] and [quoll].


A full description of this software is presented in biorXiv preprint paper:

https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.12.15.520541

This [napari] plugin contains the following tools:

- slice alignment using constrained SIFT
- two charge artifact suppression filters
    - directional fourier bandapass filter
    - line-by-line filter function optimiser and subtraction (requires charge artifact labels) - uses [chafer]
- fourier ring correlation (FRC) resolution estimation - uses [quoll]

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

<!--
Don't miss the full getting started guide to set up your new package:
https://github.com/napari/cookiecutter-napari-plugin#getting-started

and review the napari docs for plugin developers:
https://napari.org/plugins/stable/index.html
-->

## Installation

You can install `okapi-em` via [pip]:

`>pip install okapi-em`

or using napari's plugin installation engine `Plugins->Install/Uninstall Plugins...` and filter for **Okapi-EM**.

For installing in development mode , clone this package then navigate to the cloned `okapi-em` folder and run:

`>pip install -e .`

Okapi-EM is a napari plugin. Launching napari is therefore required.

`>napari`

and then navigate `Menu->Plugins->Okapi-EM`

Note that to launch napari in older versions of python (<=3.7) you will need to use the command:

`>python -m napari`

## Computing requirements
Okapi-EM does not require powerful computers to run. None of the tools use GPU accelaration.

The minimum recommended RAM depends on the size of the data being used in napari. For a full image stack of 1Gb, it is recommended that user ensure that 3Gb of RAM is available or can be used. Modern OS's can extend physical RAM using `swap` memory (Linux) or cache (in Windows and also known as virtual memory), but processing can be significantly slower.

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome. Tests can be run with [tox], please ensure
the coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request.

## Issues

There is currently a known issue with napari running in Linux machines, that it does not find the OpenGL driver correctly.
This will hopefully be resolved in the near future. If you bump into this issue we recommend trying to downgrade the python version. This is not an Okapi-EM problem.

If you encounter any problems, please file an issue along with a detailed description.

It is important to note that this plugin is part of a group of plugins ([Label-Creator](https://github.com/DKFZ-TMTRR/Label-Creator, ""Creates Labels""), [Layer-Data-Replace](https://github.com/DKFZ-TMTRR/Layer-Data-Replace, ""Replaces the data of a layer with other data""), [World2Data](https://github.com/DKFZ-TMTRR/World2Data, ""Applies a transformation to an image"")) which are intended to be used together. 

The principle workflow with this plugin is as follows:

1. Load an image of interest (ioi) using standard napari.
2. Find out meaningful transformation parameters for the ioi (or part of it) based on what you see in the viewer.
3. (optional) Save the affine transformation matrix (can later be applied to other modalities)
4. Apply the transformation to create a new, altered version of the ioi (use plugin [World2Data](https://github.com/DKFZ-TMTRR/World2Data, ""Applies a transformation to an image""))

Decisions on the parameters (step 2) are made based on the problem at hand:

- Registration: You have a second (fixed) image and you want to align your ioi to that image? Transform your whole ioi! Just play with the transformation parameters until you are happy with the alignment of ioi and fixed image.

     <i>DAPI staining (red) before (left) and after (right) manual registration on an MRI image (green).</i> 
</p>

- Histology artifact repair: Parts of your histology slice are misplaced? Transform the misplaced parts! Label them and change the transformation parameters for the misplaced parts until you are happy with their alignment with the rest of the image.

     <i> Original slice with misplaced region (left), marked using the label function (middle) and after manual adjustment (right), where the misplaced region (green) was cut and newly positioned.</i> 
</p>

To make this plugin run reasonably fast, the affine transformations are not applied to the image data in real time. Instead, the internal napari viewing parameters are changed according to the transformation parameters. Therefore, to save transformed image data, the [World2Data](https://github.com/DKFZ-TMTRR/World2Data, ""Applies a transformation to an image"") plugin is used, which calculates and saves the resulting image based on the internal napari viewing parameters.


Here we showcase a resulting multimodal 3D alignment of a whole mouse brain. The modalities are CT, MRI, simulated radiation dose distributions, DAPI staining and DNA-damage repair foci, with a Nissl-staining mouse atlas as template.

A small napari plugin for tracking platelets. Platetrack requires a segmentation and an image containing raw data. We recomend trying the napari plugin iterseg to generate these. Platetrack uses trackpy for tracking and outputs a dataframe with platelet coordinates, tracking information, and several other variables, which provide information about each platelet. 


## Installation

There are three main ways to install platetrack:

### Install Using pip

Type the following into your terminal (MacOS or Ubuntu) or annaconda prompt (windows):

```bash
pip install platetrack
```

### Install via napari hub

Type the following into your terminal (MacOS or Ubuntu) or annaconda prompt (windows):

```bash
install napari
napari
```

Once napari has opened (this may take a second the first time you open it), go to the pannel at the top of the screen and select the 'plugins' dropdown. Then select install/uninstall plugins. A new window will open showing available plugins. Either scroll down to or search 'platetrack' and click 'install'. 

### Install from Source Code
*please use this for now*

Type the following into your terminal (MacOS or Ubuntu) or annaconda prompt (windows):

```bash
git clone <repository https or ssh>
cd platetrack
pip install .
```


## Opening Platetrack
Once annotrack is properly installed you will be able to open platetrack by opening napari. You can open napari through the command line (terminal (MacOS or Ubuntu) or annaconda prompt (windows)) as follows:

```bash
napari
```

You can find the platetrack widgets by selecting the dropdown 'plugins' at the pannel at the top of the screen and selecting the platetrack widget 'track_platelets'.  


## Tracking Platelets
You can track platelets and obtain a dataframe of information about platelet observation by providing an image/s (t, z, y, x) and a segmentation (t, z, y, x). There are no specific file format requirements, only that you first load the image and segmentation into napari. The napari plugin iterseg provides a widget that will help you load zarr format files. If you have an image with multiple channels (i.e., laser colours), load them into separate napari layers. Iterseg has an option for this called ""split channels"". Otherwise, refer to the napari website for instructions on using napari layers. 

### Parameters for widget

- **labels_layer**: The napari layer containing the segmentation.
- **image_layer**: The napari layer containing the image (you only need this if you don't want to use all image layers).
- **use_all_image_layers**: If you have several image channels selecting this will obtain information about each channel. The info about image intensity will be stored in columns of the data frame named *[layer name]*_max, *[layer name]*_mean_, 
- **sample_name**: what is the name of the sample (i.e., an identifyer for the biological sample including, for example, the animal number, date, experimental conditions, etc.). This is important if you are planning to combine data frames with different treatment groups. 
- **treatment_name**: name of treatement group or experimental condition (will be added as a categorical variable). This is important if you are planning to combine data frames with different treatment groups. 
- **x_microns**: How big are pixels in the x axis (probably in microns). We need this so that physical rather than pixel coordinates can be computed. 
- **y_microns**: How big are pixels in the y axis (probably in microns). We need this so that physical rather than pixel coordinates can be computed. 
- **z_microns**: How big are pixels in the z axis (probably in microns). We need this so that physical rather than pixel coordinates can be computed. 
- **save_dir**: Directory into which you want to save output data
- **save_file**: name to give the file, 
- **save_format**: There are two options for save format ""parquet"" or ""csv"".  
- **search_range**: This is a parameter for the tracking. The search range is how far away (in physical units, e.g., microns) the tracking algorithm will look for the same platelet at the next time point. This can be reduced if trackpy is running out of computational resources due to a high number of observations (platelets)  
- **xy_origin**: If you are rotating the data (e.g., you might want to align the blood flow with the y axis like we do) this parameter defines the centre of rotation. If you would like to use the geometric centre of the image just use ""centre"". Otherwise, provide a tuple (computer word – basically a list of numbers between brackets) of coordinates in physical units in yx format (e.g., (126, 148)). 
- **rotation**: The number of degrees by which to rotate the data counterclockwise. 



## Platelet data outputted
A number of variables are computed about the platelets alongside the tracking. Each variable is reported for every platelet observation (execpt veclocity, which is only reported for tracked platelets after the first observation). 

- Mean platelet intensity in each image channel
- Max platelet pixel intensity in each channel
- Platelet elongation (0-1, 0 being least elongated, 1 being most elongated)
- Platelet flatness (0-1, 0 being least flat, 1 being most flat)
- Platelet velocity (dv)
- Platelet coordinate velocities (dvx, dvy, dvz)
- Platelet local density (density of platlets in a 15 um radius around the platelet)
- Lists of platelet neighbours within 15 um radius
- Lists of distances of each platelet neighbours within 15 um radius


## Contributing and User Support

**User support:** If you have an issue with platetrack please add an issue (go to the Issues tab at the top of the GitHub page). If your issue is a bug, please include as much information as possible to help debug the problem. Examples of information include: details about the image and segmentation data (dimensions), number of images, number of samples you are trying to take. If you are requesting an improvement, try to be as clear as possible about what you need. 

**Contributing:** If you want to contribute to platetrack, please fork the repo and if you want to make changes make a pull request with as much detail about the change as possible. Please ensure any changes you want to make don't break the existing functions.

PartSeg development branch support (and stable since 0.15.0) has experimental Qt6 support. Test are passing but not whole GUI code is covered by tests. Inf you Find any problem please report it.

## Running

If you downloaded binaries, run the `PartSeg` (or `PartSeg.exe` for Windows) file inside the `PartSeg` folder

If you installed from repository or from pip, you can run it with `PartSeg` command or `python -m PartSeg`.
First option does not work on Windows.

PartSeg export few commandline options:

- `--no_report` - disable error reporting
- `--no_dialog` - disable error reporting and error dialog. Use only when running from terminal.
- `roi` - skip launcher and start *ROI analysis* gui
- `mask`- skip launcher and start *ROI mask* gui

### Introduction
This repository hosts the version of the code used for the **[publication](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-66415-2_30)** **Registration of Multi-modal Volumetric Images by Establishing Cell Correspondence**. 

We refer to the techniques elaborated in the publication, here as **PlatyMatch**. `PlatyMatch` performs a linear registration of volumetric, microscopy images of embryos by establishing correspondences between cells. 

`PlatyMatch` first detects nuclei in the two images being considered, next calculates unique `shape context` features for each nucleus detection which encapsulates the neighborhood as seen by that nucleus, and finally identifies pairs of matching nuclei through maximum bipartite matching applied to the pairwise distance matrix generated from these features. 

### Dependencies 

You can install `PlatyMatch` via **[pip]**:

```
conda create -y -n PlatyMatchEnv python==3.8
conda activate PlatyMatchEnv
python3 -m pip install PlatyMatch
```

### Getting Started

Type in the following commands in a new terminal window.

```
conda activate PlatyMatchEnv
napari
```

Next, select `PlatyMatch` from `Plugins> Add Dock Widget`.

### Datasets

Datasets are available in **`bic_eccv_data.zip`** as release assets **[here](https://github.com/juglab/PlatyMatch/releases/tag/v0.0.1)**.
These comprise of images, nuclei detections and keypoint locations for confocal images of 12 individual specimens under the `01-insitus` directory and static snapshots of a live embryo imaged through Light Sheet Microscopy under the `02-live` directory. 
Folders with the same name in these two directories correspond in their developmental age, for example, `01-insitus/02` corresponds to `02-live/02`, `01-insitus/03` corresponds to `02-live/03` and so on.   


### Registering your data

- **Detect Nuclei** 
	- Drag and drop your images in the viewer 
	- Click on `Sync with Viewer` button to refresh the drop-down menus 
	- Select the appropriate image in the drop down menu (for which nuclei detections are desired)
	- Select **`Detect Nuclei`** from the drop-down menu
	- Specify the anisotropy factor (`Anisotropy (Z)`) (i.e. the ratio of the size of the z pixel with respect to the x or y pixel. This factor is typically more than 1.0 because the z dimension is often undersampled)
	- Ideally min scales and max scales should be estimated from your data (`min_scale` should be set as `min_radius/sqrt(3)` and `max_scale` should be set as `max_radius/sqrt(3)`. The default values of `min_scale=5` and `max_scale=9` generally works well).  
	- Click `Run Scale Space Log` button. Please note that this step takes a few minutes.
	- Wait until a confirmation message suggesting that nuclei detection is over shows up on the terminal
	- Export the nuclei locations (`Export detections to csv`) to a csv file
	- Repeat this step for all images which need to be matched




https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34229641/120660618-cd5d3980-c487-11eb-8996-326264a4df87.mp4


- **Estimate Transform**
	- In case, nuclei were exported to a csv in the `Detect Nuclei` panel, tick `csv` checkbox
	- If the nuclei detected were specified in the order id, z, y and x in the csv file, then tick `IZYXR` checkbox
	- Additionally if there is a header in the csv file, tick `Header` checkbox
	- Load the detections for the `Moving Image`, which is defined as the image which will be transformed to later match another `fixed` image
	- Load the detections for the `Fixed Image`
	- Click on `Run` pushbutton. Once the calculation is complete, a confirmation message shows up in the terminal. Export the transform matrix to a csv (Note that this step can take a few minutes)
	- It is also possible to estimate the transform in a `supervised` fashion. For this, upload the locations of a few matching keypoints in both images. These locations serve to provide a good starting point for the transform calculation. Once the keypoint files have been uploaded for both the images, then click `Run` and then export the transform matrix to a csv file 


https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34229641/120685628-53857a00-c4a0-11eb-8f92-7ffac730e28a.mp4



- **Evaluate Metrics**
	- Drag images which need to be transformed, in the viewer
	- Click on `Sync with Viewer` button to refresh the drop-down menus
	- Specify the anisotropy factor (`Moving Image Anisotropy (Z)` and `Fixed Image Anisotropy (Z)`) (i.e. the ratio of the size of the z pixel with respect to the x or y pixel. This factor is typically more than 1.0 because the z dimension is often undersampled)
	- Load the transform which was calculated in the previous steps
	- If you simply wish to export a transformed version of the moving image, click on `Export Transformed Image`
	- Additionally, one could quantify metrics such as average registration error evaluated on a few keypoints. To do so, tick the `csv` checkbox, if keypoints and detections are available as a csv file. Then load the keypoints for the moving image (`Moving Kepoints`) and the fixed image (`Fixed Keypoints`)
	- Also, upload the detections calculated in the previous steps (`Detect Nuclei`)  by uploading the `Moving Detections` and the `Fixed Detections`
	- Click on the `Run` push button
	- The text fields such as `Matching Accuracy`(0 to 1, with 1 being the best) and `Average Registration Error` (the lower the better) should become populated once the results are available

## Description

This plugin brings support for brightfield and fluorescence images to Napari,
as well as adding support for polygonal annotations in geoJSON files saved by QuPath.

Brightfield images are loaded as a single layer, incorporating also resolution
information if found on the metadata.
Fluorescence images are separated into channels annotated using the information
present in the image metadata.
Support for this latter modality is still ongoing and will improve in the coming weeks.

This package provides a python wrapper and convenience functions for
[cudaDecon](https://github.com/scopetools/cudaDecon), which is a CUDA/C++
implementation of an accelerated Richardson Lucy Deconvolution
algorithm<sup>1</sup>.

* CUDA accelerated deconvolution with a handful of artifact-reducing features.
* radially averaged OTF generation with interpolation for voxel size
  independence between PSF and data volumes
* 3D deskew, rotation, general affine transformations
* CUDA-based camera-correction for [sCMOS artifact correction](https://llspy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/camera.html)


### Install

The conda package includes the required pre-compiled libraries for Windows and Linux. See GPU driver requirements [below](#gpu-requirements)

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge pycudadecon
```

*macOS is not supported*

### 📖   &nbsp; [Documentation](http://www.talleylambert.com/pycudadecon)


### GPU requirements

This software requires a CUDA-compatible NVIDIA GPU. The underlying cudadecon
libraries have been compiled against different versions of the CUDA toolkit.
The required CUDA libraries are bundled in the conda distributions so you don't
need to install the CUDA toolkit separately.  If desired, you can pick which
version of CUDA you'd like based on your needs, but please note that different
versions of the CUDA toolkit have different GPU driver requirements:

To specify a specific cudatoolkit version, install as follows (for instance, to
use `cudatoolkit=10.2`)

```sh
conda install -c conda-forge pycudadecon cudatoolkit=10.2
```

| CUDA | Linux driver | Win driver |
| ---- | ------------ | ---------- |
| 10.2 | ≥ 440.33     | ≥ 441.22   |
| 11.0 | ≥ 450.36.06  | ≥ 451.22   |
| 11.1 | ≥ 455.23     | ≥ 456.38   |
| 11.2 | ≥ 460.27.03  | ≥ 460.82   |


If you run into trouble, feel free to [open an
issue](https://github.com/tlambert03/pycudadecon/issues) and describe your
setup.


## Usage


The [`pycudadecon.decon()`](https://www.talleylambert.com/pycudadecon/deconvolution.html#pycudadecon.decon) function is designed be able to handle most basic applications:

```python
from pycudadecon import decon

# pass filenames of an image and a PSF
result = decon('/path/to/3D_image.tif', '/path/to/3D_psf.tif')

# decon also accepts numpy arrays
result = decon(img_array, psf_array)

# the image source can also be a sequence of arrays or paths
result = decon([img_array, '/path/to/3D_image.tif'], psf_array)

# see docstrings for additional parameter options
```

For finer-tuned control, you may wish to make an OTF file from your PSF using [`pycudadecon.make_otf()`](https://www.talleylambert.com/pycudadecon/otf.html#pycudadecon.make_otf), and then use the [`pycudadecon.RLContext`](https://www.talleylambert.com/pycudadecon/deconvolution.html#pycudadecon.RLContext) context manager to setup the GPU for use with the [`pycudadecon.rl_decon()`](https://www.talleylambert.com/pycudadecon/deconvolution.html#pycudadecon.rl_decon) function.  (Note all images processed in the same context must have the same input shape).

```python
from pycudadecon import RLContext, rl_decon
from glob import glob
import tifffile

image_folder = '/path/to/some_images/'
imlist = glob(image_folder + '*488*.tif')
otf_path = '/path/to/pregenerated_otf.tif'

with tifffile.TiffFile(imlist[0]) as tf:
    imshape = tf.series[0].shape

with RLContext(imshape, otf_path, dz) as ctx:
    for impath in imlist:
        image = tifffile.imread(impath)
        result = rl_decon(image, ctx.out_shape)
        # do something with result...
```

If you have a 3D PSF volume, the [`pycudadecon.TemporaryOTF`](https://www.talleylambert.com/pycudadecon/otf.html#pycudadecon.TemporaryOTF) context manager facilitates temporary OTF generation...

```python
 # continuing with the variables from the previous example...
 psf_path = ""/path/to/psf_3D.tif""
 with TemporaryOTF(psf) as otf:
     with RLContext(imshape, otf.path, dz) as ctx:
         for impath in imlist:
             image = tifffile.imread(impath)
             result = rl_decon(image, ctx.out_shape)
             # do something with result...
```

... and that bit of code is essentially what the [`pycudadecon.decon()`](https://www.talleylambert.com/pycudadecon/deconvolution.html#pycudadecon.decon) function is doing, with a little bit of additional conveniences added in.

*Each of these functions has many options and accepts multiple keyword arguments. See the [documentation](https://www.talleylambert.com/pycudadecon/index.html) for further information on the respective functions.*

For examples and information on affine transforms, volume rotations, and deskewing (typical of light sheet volumes acquired with stage-scanning), see the [documentation on Affine Transformations](https://www.talleylambert.com/pycudadecon/affine.html)

## Puncta Quantification and Workflow
Here’s an ideal, high-level workflow for puncta segmentation and quantification. This is the recommended way of using QuantPunc. However, QuantPunc’s widgets are modularly designed so that they can be used as standalone tools. If this is your first time working with these tools, you can access the more in-depth guide mentioned above [here].

### 1. Preprocessing (optional but recommended)
QuantPunc uses wavelet denoising and adaptive histogram equalization to enhance edge information and contrast in your image. If you feel that your image has sufficient contrast and minimal noise, feel free to skip this step.

<img 
src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tehahn/quantpunc/refs/heads/main/demo_imgs/preprocessing_example.gif"" 
alt="""" 
width=""1000""
style=""border-radius: 10px; max-width: 100%;"">

### 2. Automated labeling
There are two automated labeling methods. One of them uses [skimage’s blob detection] algorithms and the other uses a random forest classifier with features inspired by [ilastik]. You also have the option to only segment puncta within ROIs. You can provide your own ROIs or create them using a labels layer in Napari.

### Random forest classifier (RFC)
You can use Napari to create annotations or provide your own. After annotating your puncta and specifying your integer labels, you can then train the RFC. Click on *Label puncta* to segment your puncta.

<img 
src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tehahn/quantpunc/refs/heads/main/demo_imgs/rfc_example.gif"" 
alt="""" 
width=""1000""
style=""border-radius: 10px; max-width: 100%;"">

### Skimage blob detection
Select your favorite blob detection algorithm from the *Method* dropdown menu. After parameterizing it, click on *Label puncta*.

src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tehahn/quantpunc/refs/heads/main/demo_imgs/skimage_blob_example.gif"" 
alt="""" 
width=""1000""
style=""border-radius: 10px; max-width: 100%;"">

### 3. Manual labeling
You can remove any puncta labels you don’t want from automated segmentation by using Napari’s layer control toolbar. You also have the option to do a full manual segmentation using a labels layer and quantify your annotations after.

### 4. Watershed segmentation (optional)
If your puncta exhibits lots of clumping, you can use the watershed tool to perform instance segmentation on your puncta labels layer. You can choose either to use a distance transform or Sobel filter to generate the elevation map.

<img 
src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tehahn/quantpunc/refs/heads/main/demo_imgs/watershed_example.gif""
alt="""" 
width=""1000""
style=""border-radius: 10px; max-width: 100%;"">

### Seed point generation
You can either provide your own seed points or generate them using skimage’s blob counting algorithms with a low min and max sigma.

### 5. Puncta counting
After you have a segmentation you’re happy with, select the image you want to quantify and click *Count puncta*. Make sure that your puncta labels layer is named after the image you’re quantifying with “_puncta” as its suffix, e.g., “your_img_puncta”.

alt="""" 
height=""750""
style=""border-radius: 10px; max-width: 100%;"">

### 6. Colocalization analysis (optional)
Colocalization is measured using the intersection over union (IoU), aka the Jaccard Index. Select two puncta labels layers and click on *Compute IoU*.

<img 
src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tehahn/quantpunc/refs/heads/main/demo_imgs/coloc_example.gif"" 
alt="""" 
height=""750""
style=""border-radius: 10px; max-width: 100%;"">

### 7. Displaying stats and saving
Click on any of the tabs in the table widget to view different summaries of the puncta you’ve quantified. To export the tables as a csv for the layer you’ve selected, click on *Save selected data*. If you want to save the data for all the images you’ve quantified click on *Save all data*.

## Contributing
Contributions are very, very welcome. QuantPunc allows you to implement your own automated puncta labeler. Look in the Github repo at [abstract_puncta_labeler] to see what methods need to be implemented and [default_puncta_labelers] for examples.

[MicroscPSF](https://github.com/MicroscPSF) project, based on [Li et al
(2017)](https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSAA.34.001029) which has been implemented in

## Install

```sh
pip install psfmodels
```

### from source

```sh
git clone https://github.com/tlambert03/PSFmodels.git
cd PSFmodels
pip install -e "".[dev]""  # will compile c code via pybind11
```

## Usage

There are two main functions in `psfmodels`: `vectorial_psf` and `scalar_psf`.
Additionally, each version has a helper function called `vectorial_psf_centered`
and `scalar_psf_centered` respectively. The main difference is that the `_psf`
functions accept a vector of Z positions `zv` (relative to coverslip) at which
PSF is calculated. As such, the point source may or may not actually be in the
center of the rendered volume. The `_psf_centered` variants, by contrast, do
_not_ accecpt `zv`, but rather accept `nz` (the number of z planes) and `dz`
(the z step size in microns), and always generates an output volume in which the
point source is positioned in the middle of the Z range, with planes equidistant
from each other. All functions accept an argument `pz`, specifying the position
of the point source relative to the coverslip. See additional keyword arguments
below

_Note, all output dimensions (`nx` and `nz`) should be odd._

```python
import psfmodels as psfm
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib.colors import PowerNorm

# generate centered psf with a point source at `pz` microns from coverslip
# shape will be (127, 127, 127)
psf = psfm.make_psf(127, 127, dxy=0.05, dz=0.05, pz=0)
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2)
ax1.imshow(psf[nz//2], norm=PowerNorm(gamma=0.4))
ax2.imshow(psf[:, nx//2], norm=PowerNorm(gamma=0.4))
plt.show()
```

![Image of PSF](fig.png)

```python
# instead of nz and dz, you can directly specify a vector of z positions
import numpy as np

# generate 31 evenly spaced Z positions from -3 to 3 microns
psf = psfm.make_psf(np.linspace(-3, 3, 31), nx=127)
psf.shape  # (31, 127, 127)
```

**all** PSF functions accept the following parameters. Units should be provided
in microns unless otherwise stated. Python API may change slightly in the
future.  See function docstrings as well.

```
nx (int):       XY size of output PSF in pixels, must be odd.
dxy (float):    pixel size in sample space (microns) [default: 0.05]
pz (float):     depth of point source relative to coverslip (in microns) [default: 0]
ti0 (float):    working distance of the objective (microns) [default: 150.0]
ni0 (float):    immersion medium refractive index, design value [default: 1.515]
ni (float):     immersion medium refractive index, experimental value [default: 1.515]
tg0 (float):    coverslip thickness, design value (microns) [default: 170.0]
tg (float):     coverslip thickness, experimental value (microns) [default: 170.0]
ng0 (float):    coverslip refractive index, design value [default: 1.515]
ng (float):     coverslip refractive index, experimental value [default: 1.515]
ns (float):     sample refractive index [default: 1.47]
wvl (float):    emission wavelength (microns) [default: 0.6]
NA (float):     numerical aperture [default: 1.4]
```

## Comparison with other models

While these models are definitely slower than the one implemented in [Li et al
(2017)](https://doi.org/10.1364/JOSAA.34.001029) and
[MicroscPSF](https://github.com/MicroscPSF), there are some interesting
differences between the scalar and vectorial approximations, particularly with
higher NA lenses, non-ideal sample refractive index, and increasing spherical
aberration with depth from the coverslip.

For an interactive comparison, see the [examples.ipynb](notebooks/examples.ipynb) Jupyter
notebook.

## Lightsheet PSF utility function

The `psfmodels.tot_psf()` function provides a quick way to simulate the total
system PSF (excitation x detection) as might be observed on a light sheet
microscope (currently, only strictly orthogonal illumination and detection are
supported).  See the [lightsheet.ipynb](notebooks/lightsheet.ipynb) Jupyter notebook for
examples.

A napari plugin for cell segmentation using the Segment Anything Model (SAM) foundation model.

![SAMCell Segmentation Example](https://github.com/saahilsanganeriya/samcell-napari/raw/main/docs/images/samcell-napari.jpg)

## Description

SAMCell-napari provides an intuitive interface for segmenting cells in microscopy images using deep learning. It leverages the power of the Segment Anything Model (SAM) adapted specifically for biological cell segmentation, providing accurate results with minimal tuning.

### Key Features:
- Simple, user-friendly interface within napari
- Compatible with SAMCell models in multiple formats (`.pt`, `.bin`, `.safetensors`)
- Support for both SAM-ViT-Base and SAM-ViT-Large model architectures
- Adjustable segmentation parameters for fine-tuning
- Real-time visualization of results
- Distance map visualization for analyzing cell proximity
- Full integration with napari's layer system
- Enhanced sliding window algorithm with advanced blending for seamless segmentation of large images

### What's New in v1.0.0:
- Support for multiple model file formats (`.pt`, `.bin`, `.safetensors`)
- Improved sliding window algorithm with smooth blending between crops
- Better handling of small images and edge cases
- Enhanced error recovery and logging
- Multiple threshold testing capability
- Optimized default thresholds for better segmentation results
- Support for both SAM-ViT-Base and SAM-ViT-Large model variants

## Installation

You can install `samcell-napari` via [pip]:

```bash
pip install samcell-napari
```

To install latest development version:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/saahilsanganeriya/samcell-napari.git
```

## Usage

1. Start napari
   ```bash
   napari
   ```

2. Load your image in napari

3. Open the SAMCell plugin:
   ```
   Plugins > samcell-napari > SAMCell Segmentation
   ```

4. Provide the path to your SAMCell model file (supports `.pt`, `.bin`, or `.safetensors` formats)
   - You can download pre-trained models from the [official SAMCell release page](https://github.com/saahilsanganeriya/SAMCell/releases/tag/v1)

5. Adjust parameters if needed:
   - Cell peak threshold: Higher values detect fewer cells (default: 0.47)
   - Cell fill threshold: Lower values create larger cells (default: 0.09)
   - Crop size: Size of image crops for processing (default: 256)

6. Click ""Run Segmentation""

7. View the segmentation results in napari as a Labels layer

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- napari 0.4.14 or higher
- PyTorch 1.9 or higher
- transformers 4.20.0 or higher
- CUDA-capable GPU recommended for faster processing

## Model Compatibility

The plugin is compatible with SAMCell model files in multiple formats:
- PyTorch model files (`.pt`)
- Binary model files (`.bin`) - including the standard `pytorch_model.bin`
- SafeTensors files (`.safetensors`) - a safer alternative to PyTorch's pickle-based format

The plugin supports models based on:
- SAM-ViT-Base architecture - Primary model type
- SAM-ViT-Large architecture - Fallback if a model doesn't load with base architecture

Pre-trained models can be downloaded from the [official SAMCell release page](https://github.com/saahilsanganeriya/SAMCell/releases/tag/v1).

Recommended models include:
- SAMCell1.0-Cellpose-cyto: Trained on the Cellpose cytoplasm dataset
- SAMCell1.0-livecell: Trained on the LiveCELL dataset

These models are part of the release assets for the paper ""SAMCell: Generalized Label-Free Biological Cell Segmentation with Segment Anything"".

## How It Works

SAMCell operates using an enhanced sliding window approach to process large images:

1. The image is divided into overlapping crops with intelligent handling of image boundaries
2. Each crop is processed through a SAM-based model
3. A distance map is created, representing cell centers and boundaries
4. The crops are stitched back together with smooth blending for seamless transitions
5. The distance map is processed to extract individual cell masks using watershed segmentation
6. Results are displayed in napari as labels

## Technical Details

### Model Type Detection

The plugin intelligently determines the appropriate SAM model architecture:
1. First tries to load the model with SAM-ViT-Base architecture
2. If that fails, automatically falls back to SAM-ViT-Large
3. This ensures maximum compatibility with various pre-trained models

### Sliding Window Algorithm

The plugin uses an advanced sliding window algorithm that:
- Handles images of any size, including those smaller than the crop size
- Creates appropriate overlaps between crops to ensure no cells are missed
- Uses a cosine-based blending mask to create smooth transitions between crops
- Fills any potential gaps using nearest neighbor interpolation

### Multiple Threshold Testing

For researchers who want to optimize segmentation parameters, the plugin includes a batch processing capability to test multiple threshold combinations at once (available via the API).

-->

## Installation

You can install `segment-embryo` via [pip]:

    pip install segment-embryo

## Usage

We will segment the cells of an embryo and count the mRNA spots tagged in another channel per cell.

### 1. Opening an image

Drag a tif- or czi-file from your file-browser and drop it into the napari window. The image will opened. The napari-plugin [napari-czifile2](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/napari-czifile2) is used to open czi-files.

### 2. Checking and modifying the voxel size 

Open the plugin [Scale-Tool plugin](https://pypi.org/project/set-calibration/) from the ``Plugins``-menu. Make sure the voxel-size values are set correctly in nm. Correct the values and the unit if necessary and press the ``Apply to all`` button.

<img src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/409b669b-675f-495f-ba11-c6ded0442b2b"" align='left' width=""30%""></img> 

### 3. Segmenting the cells of the embryo

<img src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1b464f39-47ff-412d-bdb8-c2d61837af39"" align='right' width=""30%""></img> 

Close the [Scale-Tool plugin](https://pypi.org/project/set-calibration/) and open the ``Embryo Segmentation``-plugin from the ``Plugins``-menu. Select the layer containing the membranes as ``input image`` and the layer containing the nuclei as ``nuclei image``. Press the ``run`` button and wait until the segmentation is finished. When the segmentation is finished a ``Labels layer`` with the result will be added to the layers list. 

<img src=""https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4dcf8aad-22ef-4a20-a6a6-50bcb81c7011"" align='left' width=""20%""></img> 

### 4. Exporting and curating the labels

If the labels need curation, select  the labels layer and save it to a tiff-file via the menu ``File>Save Selected Layers...``. Import the saved labels into the [Morphonet 2 standalone client](https://morphonet.org/downloads), make the corrrections and export the corrected labels to a tiff-file. Open the tiff-file in napari.

### 5. Detecting spots

Close the ``Embryo Segmentation`` plugin, select the layer containing the mRNA-spots and open the [Detect FISH spots-plugin](https://www.napari-hub.org/plugins/napari-bigfish) from the ``Plugins``-menu. Estimate the spot size in xy and z in ImageJ and enter the values into the corresponding fields. You can either estimate the threshold let the software find a threshold value. Press the ``detect spots button``. Depending on the result you might want to modify the threshold-value and run the plugin again.

### 6. Counting Spots per cell

In the ``Spot Counting`` section of the plugin, select the spots layer as input and the labels layer for the ``cytoplasm labels`` and also for the ``nuclei labels``. 

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/445da47f-c3fc-4437-803d-e635500bf1af)

Press the ``Count Spots`` button! You will obtain a table with the numbers of spots per cell. If you provide the image twice, for the cytoplasm as well as for the nuclei, the spots will all be counted inside the nuclei. If you also want to know per cell how many spots are in the nucleus and how many are in the cytoplasm, you need to provide a mask or label image for the nuclei. You can obtain one by thresholding the nucleus image or by selecting ``segment nuclei`` in step 3.

`recOrder` is a collection of computational imaging methods. It currently provides QLIPP (quantitative label-free imaging with phase and polarization), phase from defocus, and fluorescence deconvolution. 

[![Unveiling the invisible](https://github.com/mehta-lab/recOrder/blob/main/docs/images/comms_video_screenshot.png?raw=true)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JEZAaPeZhck)

Acquisition, calibration, background correction, reconstruction, and applications of QLIPP are described in the following [E-Life Paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/55502):

```

These are the kinds of data you can acquire with `recOrder` and QLIPP:

## What do I need to use `recOrder`
`recOrder` is to be used alongside a conventional widefield microscope. For QLIPP, the microscope must be fitted with an analyzer and a universal polarizer: 

https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/9554101/273073475-70afb05a-1eb7-4019-9c42-af3e07bef723.mp4

For phase-from-defocus or fluorescence deconvolution methods, the universal polarizer is optional.

The overall structure of `recOrder` is shown in Panel B, highlighting the structure of the graphical user interface (GUI) through a napari plugin and the command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to perform reconstructions.

# RedLionfish (RL) deconvolution

*Richardson-Lucy deconvolution for fishes, scientists and engineers.*


This software is for filtering 3D data using the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution algorithm.

Richardson-Lucy is an iterative deconvolution algorithm that is used to remove
point spread function (PSF) or optical transfer function (OTF) artifacts from experimental images.

The method was originally developed for astronomy to remove optical effects and simultaneously reduce poisson noise in 2D images.

[Lucy, L. B. An iterative technique for the rectification of observed distributions. The Astronomical Journal 79, 745 (1974). DOI: 10.1086/111605](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1974AJ.....79..745L/abstract)

The method can also be applied to 3D data. Nowadays this filtering technique is also widely used by microscopists.

The Richardson-Lucy deconvolution algorigthm is iterative. Each iteration involves the calculation of 2 convolutions, one element-wise multiplication and one element-wise division.

When dealing with 3D data, the Richardson-Lucy algorithm is quite computional intensive primarly due to the calculation of the convolution, and can take a while to complete depending on the resources available. Convolution is significantly sped up using FFT compared to raw convolution.

This software was developed with the aim to make the R-L computation faster by exploiting GPU resources, and with the use of FFT convolution.

To make RedLionfish easily accessible, it is available through PyPi and anaconda (conda-forge channel). A useful plugin for Napari is also available.

Please note that this software only works with 3D data. For 2D data there are many alternatives such as the DeconvolutionLab2 in Fiji (ImageJ) and sckikit-image.

## Napari plugin

You can now use the Napari's plugin installation in *Menu -> Plugins -> Install/Uninstall Plugins...*.
However, if you chose to use this method, GPU acceleration may not be available and it will use the CPU backend. Better check.

![](resources\imag1.jpg)

Alternatively, if you follow the installation instructions below, and install the napari in the same python environment
then the plugin should be immediately available in the *Menu -> Plugins -> RedLionfish*.


## Installation

Previously there was a problem in installing using `pip`, because no PyOpenCL wheels for windows were avaiable. It is now avaialble.

This package can be installed using pip or conda.

Napari plugin installation engine can also be used to install this package.


### Install from PyPi

```
pip install redlionfish
```


### Conda install

This package is available in conda-forge channel.
It contains the precompiled libraries and it will install all the requirments for GPU-accelerated RL calculations.

`conda install redlionfish -c conda-forge`

In Linux , the package `ocl-icd-system` may also be useful.

```
conda install reikna pyopencl ocl-icd-system -c conda-forge
```


#### Manual installation using the conda package file.

Download the appropriate conda package .bz2 at [https://github.com/rosalindfranklininstitute/RedLionfish/releases](https://github.com/rosalindfranklininstitute/RedLionfish/releases)

In the command line, successively run:
```
conda install <filename.bz2>
conda update --all -c conda-forge
```
The second line is needed because you are installing from a local file, conda installer will not install dependencies. Right after this you should run the update command given.


### Manual installation (advanced and for developers)

Please note that in order to use OpenCL GPU accelerations, PyOpenCL must be installed.
The best way to get it working is to install it under a conda environment.

The installation is similar to the previously described for PyPi.

`conda install reikna pyopencl`

or

`conda install reikna pyopencl ocl-icd-system -c conda-forge` (Linux)

Clone/download from source [https://github.com/rosalindfranklininstitute/RedLionfish/](https://github.com/rosalindfranklininstitute/RedLionfish/)

and run

`python setup.py install`


### Debug installation
If you want to test and modify the code then you should probably install in debug mode using:

`python setup.py develop`

or

`pip install -e .`


## More information

The software has algorithms for Richardson-Lucy deconvolution that use either CPU and GPU.

The CPU version is very similar to the [skimage.restoration.richardson_lucy](https://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.restoration.html#skimage.restoration.richardson_lucy) code, with improvments in speed.
major differences are:

- the convolution steps use FFT only.
- PSF and PSF-flipped FFTs are precalculated before starting iterations.

The GPU version, was written in to use Reikna package, which does FFT using OpenCL, via PyOpenCL.

Unfortunately, a major limitation in RAM usage exists with PyOpenCL.
Large 3D data volumes with cause out-of-memory error when trying to upload data to the GPU for FFT calculations.
As such, to overcome this problem, a block algorithm is used, which splits data into blocks with padded data.
The results are then combined together to give the final result.
This affects the perfomance of the calculation rather significantly, but with the advantage of being possible to handle large data volumes.

If Richardson-Lucy deconvolution using the GPU method fails, RedLionfish will fallback to CPU calculation. Check console output for messages.

If you are using the RedLionfish in your code, note that, by default, `def doRLDeconvolutionFromNpArrays()` method it uses the GPU OpenCL version.

## Testing

Use pytest to test the package. Test files are in `/test` folder

Many examples can be found in `/scripts' folder.

A useful way to test and benchmark the package installation can be run from the proect root using the command:

'python scripts/test_and_benchm.py'

or in windows

'python scripts\test_and_benchm.py'

This will print out information about your GPU device (if available) and run some deconvolutions.
It initially creates some data programatically, convolutes with a gaussian PSF, and add Poisson noise.
Then it executes executes the
Richardson-Lucy deconvolution calculation using CPU and GPU methods, for 10 iterations.
During the calculation it will print some information to the console/terminal, including the time it takes to run the calculation.


Computer generated data and an experimental PSF can be found in `scripts\testdata`

### Testing Redlionfish in napari

Here is an example testing the Redlionfish plugin in napari:

1. load data `scripts/testdata/gendata_psfconv_poiss_large.tif` (can use draga and drop)
2. load psf data `scripts/testdata/PSF_RFI_8bit.tif`
3. In the RedLionfish side window ensure that 'gendata_psfconv_poiss_large' is selected in data dropdown widget, and `PSF_RFI_8bit` is selected in psfdata widget.
4. Choose number of iterations (default=10)
5. Click 'Go' button and wait until result shows as a new data layer.
6. Use controls of the left panel to compare before and after RL deconvolution: select 'RL-deconvolution' layer and set colormap to red. Hide PSF_RFI_8bit. Make sure that both 'RL-deconvolution' and 'gendata-psfconv' are visible. Now, hide/unhide RL-deconvolution layer to see before and after deconvolution. Adjust contrast limits of each layer as desired.


## GPU vs CPU

You may notice that choosing GPU does not make RL-calculation much faster compared with CPU, and sometimes is slower.

Which method runs the R-L deconvolution faster. That depends on the computer configuration/architecture.

GPU calculations will be generally faster than CPU with bigger data volumes.

GPU calculation will be significantly faster if using a dedicated GPU card.

Please see benchmark values that highlights significant variability in calculation speeds.


[benchmark_results.md](benchmark_results.md)


## Coding

Please feel free to browse the `/scripts` folder for examples.

In order to use the functions, add the follwoing import to your code,

`import RedLionfishDeconv`

The most useful function is perhaps the following.

`def doRLDeconvolutionFromNpArrays(data_np , psf_np ,*, niter=10, method='gpu', useBlockAlgorithm=False, callbkTickFunc=None, resAsUint8 = False) `

This will do the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution on the data_np (numpy, 3 dimensional data volume) using the provided PSF data volume, for 10 iterations. GPU method is generally faster but it may fail. If it does fail, the program will automatically use the CPU version that uses the scipy fft package.



## Manually building the conda package

For this installation, ensure that the conda-build package is installed

`conda install conda-build`

In windows, simply execute

`conda-create-package.bat`


Or, execute the following command-line to create the installation package.

`conda-build --output-folder ./conda-built-packages -c conda-forge conda-recipe`

and the conda package will be created in folder *conda-built-packages*.

Otherwise, navigate to `conda-recipe`, and execute on the command-line `conda build .`

It will take a while to complete.

## Description
Easy to use plugin for opening raw Snouty files and converting them to native view.

Allows for saving to ome.tif files with corresponding OME-XML based metadata.

Also allows for bulk deskewing and saving directories.

![Example](https://i.imgur.com/VirE5DM.gif)

## Intended Audience & Supported Data
This plugin is intended for those using a SOLS (Snouty) microscope collected via
[Alfred Millett-Sikking's code](https://github.com/amsikking/SOLS_microscope).

This plugin accepts a folder with at least subdirectories of data and metadata as an input.

## Quickstart

### A. Getting the plugin working (choose either a or b, you don't have to do both)
#### a. Through pip-install:
1. pip install snouty-viewer (within a virtual environment of Python 3.8, 3.9, or 3.10 recommended)
2. Open up napari
#### b. Through Napari:
1. Open up napari
2. Plugins > Install/Uninstall plugins
3. Search for ""snouty-viewer""
4. Install
5. (Maybe need to) reopen napari

### B. Viewing raw Snouty data
- Drag and drop a root folder of your Snouty data. This is the folder that includes the data and metadata subfolders.
- Select ""Snouty Viewer"" for opening.

### C. Converting raw Snouty data to its native view
1. Click plugins, snouty-viewer -> Native View
2. Select the file you want to convert
3. Press Deskew

### D. Saving your native view file
1. Select the channel (or multi-channel) layer you want to save
2. File > Save Selected Layer(s)...
3. Select where you want to save your file
4. Title your file, "".ome.tif"" will automatically be appended.
5. Save with ""Snouty Writer""
6. Wait (this could take a few minutes depending on your file's size and your hardware)

### E. Batch saving
1. Click plugins, snouty-viewer -> Batch Deskew & Save
2. Input a directory (without quotes) that contains 1 or more Snouty-acquired directories.
3. If you want to view your deskewed outputs, check the box.
4. If you want to automatically save the deskewed outputs, check the box.
5. Press Deskew and save
6. Wait (this could take a few minutes depending on your files' sizes and your hardware)

A Napari plugin segmenting yeast cells and fluo spots to extract statistics.

----------------------------------

The skeleton on this [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.


## Introduction

> This Napari plugin's purpose is to extract statistics about fluo spots in yeast cells. We produce a segmentation of cells (based on the brightfield) and a segmentation of spots (based on the fluo channel). Then, we associate the measures to each cells.

Unless you use the `NapariJ` plugin to open images, or the `cast_extension.ijm` script to cast files, you can only launch this plugin on `.tif` images.

For now, the code produces JSON files compiling the metrics such as:
- The number of spots per cell.
- The average intensity of a spot.
- The area of each spot.
- The location of each spot.

We provide `cast_extension.ijm` which is another script meant to be used in Fiji/ImageJ. It is able to convert `.nd` and `.czi` images into basic `.tif` images so you can open them in Napari.

You can process your images either in __one-shot__ _(image per image)_ or in __batch mode__ _(by providing the path to a folder)_. In case you used batch mode, a control image is created so you can quickly check whether your segmentation was correctly performed.

Required packages in your environment:
- `napari`
- `cellpose`
- `numpy`
- `skimage`
- `termcolor`
- `matplotlib`
- `cv2`


## Installation

You can install `spots-in-yeasts` via [pip]:

    pip install spots-in-yeasts



To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/MontpellierRessourcesImagerie/spots-in-yeasts.git


## Example

- Your images must have exactly two channels. The number of slices in each channel is totally up to you.
- __First channel__: fluo spots, __second channel__: brightfield.
- If you want to use the batch mode, you must use `.tif` images.

The two following images are the __brightfield__ and __fluo spots__ channels of the same image:

![Brightfield](https://dev.mri.cnrs.fr/attachments/download/3017/bf.png)
![Spots](https://dev.mri.cnrs.fr/attachments/download/3018/fluo.png)

The following images are the __cells labels__ and the __spots positions__:

![Labeled cells](https://dev.mri.cnrs.fr/attachments/download/3016/cells.png)
![Detected spots](https://dev.mri.cnrs.fr/attachments/download/3019/spots.png)

## Usage

### One-shot

- Open Napari. Keep the terminal opened, it provides lots of information.
- Before starting, make sure that no layer is currently open. You can clear your viewer with the `Clear layers` button.
- Drag'n'drop your image into the Napari viewer. It should show up in the left column.
- Click the `Split channels` button to separate the brightfield and the fluo on two different layers. Now, you should have two layers named ""brightfield"" and ""fluo-spots"".
- To segment yeast cells, click the `Segment cells` button. The interface will certainly freeze during a few seconds (~10/30s). A new layer should appear, containing a value of intensity for each individual cell.
- Click on the `Segment spots` button. This is a pretty fast operation. A new layer containing spots just appeared. Spots are represented as small white dots. You can change that in the layer's settings you struggle controling the result.
- Finally, you can use the `Extract stats` button to create a JSON file. This file will automatically be opened in your default text editor, but it is a __temporary file__, which means that it is not saved anywhere and will get lost if you don't save it yourself.
- Once you are done, you can press the `Clear layers` button again and pass to your next image, repeating the previous steps.

### Batch mode

- Before starting, you need a folder containing correctly formated `.tif` files.
- Open Napari, and keep the terminal opened to see provided information.
- Set the `input folder` field to your folder containing `.tif` images.
- Set the `output folder` field to the path of a folder (preferably empty) that will receive the control images and the JSON files generated by the script.
- You can click the `Run batch` button to launch the process.

__Note:__ In batch mode, your viewer won't show anything. You must rely on the terminal's content and the progress bar to know what is going on. To open the progress bar in Napari, click on `activity` in the lower-right corner.

## Messages:

- `Export directory set to: /some/path/to/output`: Folder provided by the user to receive produced files (JSON, controls)
- `===== Working on: d1-230421-11S_2 (1/32)====`: Name of the image currently processed and its rank. For example here, ""d1-230421-11S_2"" is being processed and it is the first image processed from a folder containing 32 images.
- `Selected slices: (4, 8). (11 slices available)`: The script doesn't use all the slices in the image. Instead, it detects the most is-focus slice and takes N slices before and after it. In this example, 11 slices were available in the image. We are using the slices 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 for processing, so the most in-focus one is the 6th.
- `Segmenting cells...`: Notification that the script started segmenting yeasts cells.
- `Cells segmentation done. 219 cells found.`: End of cells segmentation. This message also provides you with the number of indiviual detected. This number is displayed before labels touching the borders are removed.
- `Segmented cells from d1-230421-11S_2 in 10.0s.`: Operations are timed. This is just the time report of cells segmentation.
- `Starting spots segmentation...`: Notification that the script started segmenting spots in the fluo channel.
- `102 spots found .`: Number of spots detected during the segmentation.
- `Segmented spots from d1-230421-11S_2 in 1.0s.`: Duration elapsed during spots segmentation.
- `Spots exported to: /some/path/to/output/d1-230421-11S_2.json`: Path to the exported metrics.
- `Focused slice too far from center!`: We don't use all the slices available. We detect the most in-focus one and take N slices before and after. This message means that there isn't N slices available after (or before) the most in-focus one. The process won't get interupted, but you want to be more careful about the segmentation of this image.
- `The image d1-230421 BG- failed to be processed.`: A basic sanity check is applied to the results before they get exported to reduce the amount of manual checking to perform. This message simply means that either the cells segmentation, or the spots segmentation is so bad that this image will be skipped.
- `========= DONE. (288.0s) =========`: Indicates that all the images contained in your folder were processed, the batch is over. The total amount of time if also displayed.

# SMO

SMO is a Python package that implements the Silver Mountain Operator (SMO), which allows to recover an unbiased estimation of the background intensity distribution in a robust way.

We provide an easy to use Python package and plugins for some of the major image processing softwares: [napari](https://napari.org), [CellProfiler](https://cellprofiler.org), and [ImageJ](https://imagej.net) / [FIJI](https://fiji.sc). See Plugins section below.

## Citation

To learn more about the theory behind SMO, you can read the [pre-print in BioRxiv](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.09.467975).

If you use this software, please cite that pre-print.

## Usage

To obtain a background-corrected image, it is as straightforward as:

```python
import skimage.data
from smo import SMO

image = skimage.data.human_mitosis()
smo = SMO(sigma=0, size=7, shape=(1024, 1024))
background_corrected_image = smo.bg_corrected(image)
```

where we used a sample image from `scikit-image`.
By default,
the background correction subtracts the median value of the background distribution.
Note that the background regions will end up with negative values,
but with a median value of 0.

A notebook explaining in more detail the meaning of the parameters and other possible uses for SMO is available here: [smo/examples/usage.ipynb](https://github.com/maurosilber/SMO/blob/main/smo/examples/usage.ipynb) [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/maurosilber/SMO/blob/main/smo/examples/usage.ipynb).

## Installation

It can be installed with `pip` from PyPI:

```
pip install smo
```

or with `conda` from the conda-forge channel:

```
conda install -c conda-forge smo
```

This project provides the [napari](https://napari.org/) plugin for [StarDist](https://github.com/stardist/stardist), a deep learning based 2D and 3D object detection method with star-convex shapes. StarDist has originally been developed (see [papers](https://github.com/stardist/stardist#stardist---object-detection-with-star-convex-shapes)) for the segmentation of densely packed cell nuclei in challenging images with low signal-to-noise ratios. The plugin allows to apply pretrained and custom trained models from within napari.

If you use this plugin for your research, please [cite us](https://github.com/stardist/stardist#how-to-cite).

![Screenshot](https://github.com/stardist/stardist-napari/raw/main/images/stardist_napari_screenshot_small.png)


## Installation

Install the plugin with `pip install stardist-napari` or from within napari via `Plugins > Install/Uninstall Plugins…`. If you want GPU-accelerated prediction, please read the more detailed [installation instructions](https://github.com/stardist/stardist#installation) for StarDist.

- You can activate the plugin in napari via `Plugins > stardist-napari: StarDist`.
- Example images for testing are provided via `File > Open Sample > stardist-napari`.


## Documentation

The two main buttons at the bottom of the plugin are (see right side of screenshot above):

**Restore Defaults**: Restore default values for [inputs](#inputs) (exceptions: *Input Image*, *Image Axes*, *Custom Model*).

**Run**: Start the prediction with the selected inputs and create the [outputs](#outputs) when done.

All plugin activity is shown in the napari *activity dock*, which can be shown/hidden by clicking on the word `activity` next to the little arrow at the bottom right of the napari window.

### Inputs

The plugin does perform input validation, i.e. it will disable the `Run` button if it detects a problem with the selected inputs. Problematic input fields are highlighted with a ""lightcoral"" background color ![](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f08080/f08080.png), and their [*tooltips*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tooltip) typically explain what the problem is. Some error messages are shown at the bottom in napari's status bar, such as for incompatibilities between multiple input fields. Input fields with warnings (also explained via tooltips) are highlighted with an orange background color ![](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffa500/ffa500.png).

**Input Image**: Select a napari layer of type `Image` as the input.  
*Tooltip:* Shows the shape of the image.

**Image Axes**: String that describes the semantic image axes and their order, e.g. `YX` for a 2D image. This parameter is automatically chosen (i.e. guessed) when a new input image is selected and should work in most cases. Permissible axis values are: `X` (width/columns), `Y` (height/rows), `Z` (depth/planes), `C` (channels), `T` (frames/time).  
*Tooltip:* Shows the mapping of semantic axes to the shape of the selected input image.

**Predict on field of view (only for 2D models in 2D view)**: If enabled, the StarDist prediction is only applied to the current field of view of the napari viewer. As the name of this checkbox indicates, this only works for 2D StarDist models and when the napari viewer is in 2D viewing mode. The checkbox is not even shown if those conditions are not met.

#### *Neural Network Prediction*

**Model Type**: Choice whether to use registered pre-trained models (`2D`, `3D`) or provide a path to a model folder (`Custom 2D/3D`). Based on this choice, either the input for *Pre-trained Model* or *Custom Model* is shown below.  
(Further information regarding pre-trained models: [how to register your own model](https://nbviewer.org/github/CSBDeep/CSBDeep/blob/master/examples/other/technical.ipynb#Registry-for-pretrained-models), [model registration in StarDist](https://github.com/stardist/stardist/blob/f73cdc44f718d36844b38c1f1662dbb66d157182/stardist/models/__init__.py#L17-L29).)

**Pre-trained Model**: Select a registered pre-trained model from a list. The first time a model is selected, it is downloaded and cached locally.

**Custom Model**: Provide a path to a StarDist model folder, containing at least `config.json` and a compatible neural network weights file (with suffix `.h5` or `.hdf5`). If present, `thresholds.json` is also loaded and its values can be used via the button *Set optimized postprocessing thresholds (for selected model)*. If you want to use [a model from bioimage.io](https://bioimage.io/#/?tags=stardist&type=model), you first need to convert it to the regular StarDist model folder format (see how to do this [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/stardist/stardist/blob/main/examples/other2D/bioimageio.ipynb#Import-bioimage.io-model-as-StarDist-model)).

**Model Axes**: A read-only text field that shows the semantic axes that the currently selected model expects as input. Additionally, we show the number of expected input channels, e.g. `YXC[2]` to indicate that the model expects a 2D input image with 2 channels. Seeing the model axes is helpful to understand whether the axes of the input image are compatible or not.

**Normalize Image**: A checkbox to indicate whether to perform [percentile-based input image normalization](https://forum.image.sc/t/normalization-in-stardist/41696/2) or not. This should be checked if the input image wasn't [manually normalized](https://forum.image.sc/t/stardist-extension/37696/7) such that most pixel values are in the range 0 to 1. If unchecked, inputs *Percentile low* and *Percentile high* are hidden.

**Percentile low**: Percentile value of input pixel distribution that is mapped to 0 (~min value). If there aren't any outlier pixels in your image, you may use percentile `0` to do a standard [min-max image normalization](https://www.codecademy.com/article/normalization).

**Percentile high**: Percentile value of input pixel distribution that is mapped to 1 (~max value). If there aren't any outlier pixels in your image, you may use percentile `100` to do a standard [min-max image normalization](https://www.codecademy.com/article/normalization).

**Input image scaling**: Number or list of numbers (one per input axis) to scale the input image before prediction and rescale the output accordingly. For example, a value of `0.5` indicates that all spatial axes are downscaled to half their size before prediction, and that the outputs are scaled to double their size. This is useful to adapt to different object sizes in the input image.  
*Tooltip:* Shows the mapping of scale values to the semantic axes of the selected input image.

#### *NMS Postprocessing*

**Probability/Score Threshold**: Determine the number of object candidates to enter non-maximum suppression. Higher values lead to fewer segmented objects, but will likely avoid false positives. The selected model may have an associated threshold value, which can be loaded via the *Set optimized postprocessing thresholds (for selected model)* button.

**Overlap Threshold**: Determine when two objects are considered the same during non-maximum suppression. Higher values allow segmented objects to overlap substantially. The selected model may have an associated threshold value, which can be loaded via the *Set optimized postprocessing thresholds (for selected model)* button.

**Output Type**: Choose format of [outputs](#outputs) (see below for details). Selecting `Label Image` will create the outputs *StarDist labels* and *StarDist class labels* (for multi-class models only) as napari `Labels` layers. Selecting `Polygons / Polyhedra` will instead return the output *StarDist polygons* as a napari `Shapes` layer for a 2D model, or *StarDist polyhedra* as a napari `Surface` layer for a 3D model. Selecting `Both` will return both types of outputs.

#### *Advanced Options*

**Number of Tiles**: String `None` (to disable tiling) or list of integer numbers (one per axis of input image) to determine how the input image is tiled before the CNN prediction is computed on each tile individually. This is needed to avoid (GPU) memory issues that can occur for large input images. Note that the NMS postprocessing is still run only once with candidates from the predictions of all image tiles.  
*Tooltip:* Shows the mapping of tile values to the semantic axes of the selected input image.

**Normalization Axes**: String of semantic axes which are jointly normalized (if they are present in the input image). For example, the default value `ZYX` indicates that all spatial axes are always normalized together; if an image has multiple channels, the pixels will be normalized separately per channel (e.g. this is what typically makes sense for fluorescence microscopy where channels are independent). On the other hand, the channels in RGB color images typically need to be normalized jointly, hence using `ZYXC` makes sense in this case. Note: if an image is explicitly opened with `rgb=True` in napari, the channels are automatically normalized together.  
*Tooltip:* Shows a brief explanation.

**Time-lapse Labels**: If the input is a time-lapse/movie, each frame is first independently processed by StarDist. If `Separate per frame (no processing)` is chosen, the object ids in the label images of each frame are not modified, i.e. they are consecutive integers that always start at 1. Selecting `Unique through time` will cause object ids to be unique over time, i.e. the smallest object id in a given frame is larger than the largest object id of the previous frame. Finally, choosing `Match to previous frame (via overlap)` will perform a simple form of [greedy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm) matching/tracking, where object ids are propagated from one frame to the next based on object overlap.

**Show CNN Output**: Create additional [outputs](#outputs) (see below for details) *StarDist probability* and *StarDist distances* that show the direct results of the CNN prediction which are the inputs to the NMS postprocessing. Additionally, *StarDist class probabilities* is created for multi-class models.

**Set optimized postprocessing thresholds (for selected model)**: Button to set *Probability/Score Threshold* and *Overlap Threshold* to the values provided by the selected model. Nothing is changed if the model does not provide threshold values.

### Outputs

**StarDist polygons**: The detected/segmented 2D objects as polygons (napari `Shapes` layer).

**StarDist polyhedra**: The detected/segmented 3D objects as surfaces (napari `Surface` layer).

**StarDist labels**: The detected/segmented 2D/3D objects as a *label image* (napari `Labels` layer). In an integer-valued label image, the value of a given pixel denotes the id of the object that it belongs to. For example, all pixels with value 5 belong to the object with id 5. All background pixels (that don't belong to any object) have value 0.

**StarDist class labels** ([multi-class models](https://nbviewer.org/github/stardist/stardist/blob/master/examples/other2D/multiclass.ipynb) only): The classes of detected/segmented 2D/3D objects as a *semantic segmentation labeling* (napari `Labels` layer). The integer value of a given pixel denotes the class id of the object that it belongs to. For example, all pixels with value 3 belong to the object class 3. Note that all pixels that belong to a specific object instance (as returned by *StarDist labels*) do have the same object class here. All background pixels (that don't belong to an object class) have value 0.

**StarDist probability**: The object probabilities predicted by the neural network as a single-channel image (napari `Image` layer).

**StarDist distances**: The radial distances predicted by the neural network as a multi-channel image (napari `Image` layer).

**StarDist class probabilities** ([multi-class models](https://nbviewer.org/github/stardist/stardist/blob/master/examples/other2D/multiclass.ipynb) only): The object class probabilities predicted by the neural network as a multi-channel image (napari `Image` layer).

Gamified image segmentation quality estimation

![img.png](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/the-segmentation-game/raw/main/images/screencast.gif)

----------------------------------

## Usage

The Segmentation Game allows to quantitatively compare segmentation results to a given ground truth annotation.
This allows fine-tuning parameters of image processing workflows to get optimal segmentation quality. 
It also allows comparing different segmentation algorithms and identify which algorithm performs best objectively.

The game can be found in napari's `Tools > Games > The Segmentation Game` menu.

### Ground Truth Annotation

Before you can start playing the game, some annotated cells/nuclei are necessary to later compute segmentation quality from.
Depending on the used metric, it might be sufficient to annotate a hand full of objects. 
Use napari's annotation tools as shown below. 
Use the `+` and `-` keys on your keyboard to increase and decrease the label number that is currently drawn.
Note: Avoid label gaps. The labels must be continuously subsequent. If there are pixels annotated with value 2, there must be pixels annotated with value 1.

![](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/the-segmentation-game/raw/main/images/annotation.gif)

### Parameter tuning

If you work with one of [napari's segmentation plugins](https://www.napari-hub.org/?search=segmentation&sort=relevance&page=1) that produce labels layers,
you can tune their parameters and see how this influences segmentation quality.

![](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf/the-segmentation-game/raw/main/images/parameter_tuning.gif)

### Segmentation algorithm comparison

If you aim at comparing different segmentation algorithms, you can collect their results in label layers in the napari viewer.
You can then select the segmentation result from the corresponding pulldown and save quantitative comparison results in the Highscore table.

## Metrics

Currently, these metrics are implemented:
* Jaccard Index (sparse): The [Jaccard Index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaccard_index) is a measure of overlap. 
  It lies between 0 (no overlap) and 1 (perfect overlap). 
  For each annotated ground truth label, the maximum overlap of any segmented label is determined. 
  The mean overlap of all annotated labels serves as metric result.
* Jaccard Index (binary): The annotated ground truth labels and the segmentation result are first binarized considering all annotated pixels as positive and all other labels as negative.
  Afterwards, the overlap between the two binary images is computed. This allows comparing binary segmentation algorithms, such as thresholding techniques.
* Jaccard Index (binary, sparse): The annotated ground truth image can contain values 1 (negative, false) and 2 (positive, true) and
  the segmentation result image will be binarized (0: False, otherwise: True). This allows comparing object/no-object annotations with label images.
 
 
Receiver operating characteristic ([ROC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Receiver_operating_characteristic))
  
Consider a two-class thresholding problem (binary pixel-wise classification object/background), in which the outcomes are labeled either as positive (p) or negative (n). There are four possible outcomes from a binary classifier. If the outcome from a prediction is p and the actual value is also p, then it is called a true positive (TP); however if the actual value is n then it is said to be a false positive (FP). Conversely, a true negative (TN) has occurred when both the prediction outcome and the actual value are n, and false negative (FN) is when the prediction outcome is n while the actual value is p. We can organize result in table called confusion matrix, based on positive/neagtive results in row and true and false result in columns. From the confucsion matrix we can get many metrics with various usefulness. The curently implemented used for classification evaluation are:

* Sensitivity, recall, hit rate, or true positive rate (TPR): (TP)/ (TP + FP), Sensitivity and specificity mathematically describe the accuracy of a test which reports the presence or absence of a condition. Individuals for which the condition is satisfied are considered ""positive"" and those for which it is not are considered ""negative"".
* Specificity, selectivity or true negative rate (TNR): (TN)/ (TN + FN), Sensitivity and specificity mathematically describe the accuracy of a test which reports the presence or absence of a condition. Individuals for which the condition is satisfied are considered ""positive"" and those for which it is not are considered ""negative"".
* Precision or positive predictive value (PPV): (TP)/ (TP + FP), in computing and information science is the process of obtaining information system resources that are relevant to an information need from a collection of those resources. It is quantification for the TP events.
* Accuracy: (TP + TN)/ (TP + FP + TN + FN), Accuracy measures observational error. Accuracy is how close or far off a given set of measurements are to their true value. However, it usually fails in imbalanced sets.
* Balanced Accuracy: (TP/(TP+FN) + TN/(TN+FP))/2, Balanced Accuracy is trying to even out problems of accuracy in imbalanced sets.
* F1 Score: 2*TP/(2*TP + FP + TN + FN), In statistical analysis of binary classification, the F-score or F-measure is a measure of a test's accuracy. It is calculated from the precision and recall of the test, where the precision is the number of true positive results divided by the number of all positive results, including those not identified.
* Threat score (TS) or critical success index (CSI): TP/(TP + FP + FN), TC is another name for Jaccard Index (binary).

The ROC measures or confusion matrix is invaluable in cases when when our binary classifier is not ideal (which is often) and we are aiming to not get a general good result but specified low error. In that case we usually need to decide for some trade off, for example we need all (as many as possible) classified true positive objects, but we do not mind getting (usually as few as possible) false positive objects.

**What we want to achieve**

![Precision-versus-accuracy, source: 10.13140/RG.2.1.1668.7603](https://github.com/martinschatz-cz/the-segmentation-game/blob/main/images/Precision-versus-accuracy.png)

When we are doing semantic segmentation, we are aiming to classify each pixel (ideally correctly) to each of our classes. But that can be hugr ammount of information, and our object might have significantly much less pixels then number of pixels belonging to background and/or other classes. Before choosing right metrics, we need to set up goal for our classification results. Idealy, we would like to have high accuracy and precission for ach class (as is on pictur above), but we might be happy getting high accuracy with good precision. Realisticaly we might need to be more specific, as to choose how big error we are prepared to accept, or decide if it is acceptable to have FN findings but no FP.

Picking up a metric for highly unbalanced classification as in semantic segmentation is challenging. Most of the classic metrics wil fail (but they are stil usable object-wise). And we usually stick up with Jaccard Index/Threat score, F1 Score or anything that will tell us result for TP rate (as we expect we will have less pixels for objects then background and/or other classes).

## Literature recommendation

How to choose the right metric for comparing segmentation results is explained in this paper:
* [Metrics reloaded: Pitfalls and recommendations for image analysis validation. Maier-Hein L. and Reinke A. et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.01653)

We provide a neural network model for segmenting the lungs of the mice. The model is based on the [U-Net](https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/people/ronneber/u-net/) architecture.

<p align=""center"">
    <img src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qchapp/lungs-segmentation/refs/heads/master/images/main_fig.png"" height=""500"">
</p>

The goal of our tool is to provid a reliable way to segment the lungs in mouse CT scans. The U-net model produces a binary mask representing the segmentation of the lungs.

## Try the model 

- [Install the package](#installation)
- [Follow the usage instructions](#usage-in-napari)

## Installation

We recommend performing the installation in a clean Python environment.

The code requires `python>=3.9`, as well as `pytorch>=2.0`. Please install Pytorch first and separately following the instructions for your platform on [pytorch.org](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/).

Install `unet_lungs_segmentation` using *pip* after you've installed Pytorch:

```sh
pip install unet_lungs_segmentation
```

or clone the repository and install with:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/qchapp/lungs-segmentation.git
pip install -e .
```

## Models

The model weights (~1 GB) will be automatically downloaded from [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/qchapp/unet-lungs-segmentation-weights).


## Usage in Napari

[Napari](https://napari.org/stable/) is a multi-dimensional image viewer for python. To use our model in Napari, start the viewer with

```sh
napari
```

To open an image, use `File > Open files` or drag-and-drop an image into the viewer window. If you want to open medical image formats such as NIFTI directly, consider installing the [napari-medical-image-formats](https://pypi.org/project/napari-medical-image-formats/) plugin.

**Sample data**: To test the model, you can run it on our provided sample image. In Napari, open the image from `File > Open Sample > Mouse lung CT scan`.

Next, in the menu bar select `Plugins > Lungs segmentation (unet_lungs_segmentation)`. Select an image and run it by pressing the ""Segment lungs"" button.

<p align=""center"">
    <img src=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qchapp/lungs-segmentation/refs/heads/master/images/napari-screenshot.png"" height=""500"">
</p>

## Usage as a library

You can run a model in just a few lines of code to produce a segmentation mask from an image (represented as a numpy array).

```py
from unet_lungs_segmentation import LungsPredict

lungs_predict = LungsPredict()
mask = lungs_predict.segment_lungs(your_image)
```
or if you want to apply a specific `threshold` (`float` between 0 and 1):
```py
mask = lungs_predict.segment_lungs(your_image, threshold)
```

## Usage as a CLI

Run inference on an image from the command-line. For example:

```sh
uls_predict_image -i /path/to/folder/image_001.tif [-t <threshold>]
```

The `<threshold>` will be applied to the predicted image in order to have a binary mask. A default threshold of 0.5 will be applied if none is given. Should be a `float` between 0 and 1.

The command will save the segmentation next to the image:
```
folder/
    ├── image_001.tif
    ├── image_001_mask.tif
```

Run inference in batch on all images in a folder:

```sh
uls_predict_folder -i /path/to/folder/ [-t <threshold>]
```
Will produce:
```
folder/
    ├── image_001.tif
    ├── image_001_mask.tif
    ├── image_002.tif
    ├── image_002_mask.tif
```

## Dataset

Our model was trained using a dataset of `355` images coming from 17 different experiments, 2 different scanners and validated on `62` images.

## Segmentation Algorithm

VollSeg is more than just a single segmentation algorithm; it is a meticulously designed modular segmentation tool tailored to diverse model organisms and imaging methods. While a U-Net might suffice for certain image samples, others might benefit from utilizing StarDist, and some could require a blend of both, potentially coupled with denoising or region of interest models. The pivotal decision left to make is how to select the most appropriate VollSeg configuration for your dataset, a question we comprehensively address in our [documentation website](https://kapoorlabs-caped.github.io/vollseg-napari/).

This project provides the [napari](https://napari.org/) plugin for [VollSeg](https://github.com/kapoorlab/vollseg), a deep learning based 2D and 3D segmentation tool for irregular shaped cells. VollSeg has originally been developed (see [papers](http://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2021/varun_kapoor.html)) for the segmentation of densely packed membrane labelled cells in challenging images with low signal-to-noise ratios. The plugin allows to apply pretrained and custom trained models from within napari.
For detailed demo of the plugin see these [videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W_gKrLWKNpQ) and a short video about the [parameter selection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7tQMn_u8_7s&t=1s) 


## Installation & Usage

Install the plugin with `pip install vollseg-napari` or from within napari via `Plugins > Install/Uninstall Package(s)…`. 

You can activate the plugin in napari via `Plugins > VollSeg: VollSeg`. Example images for testing are provided via `File > Open Sample > VollSeg`.

If you use this plugin for your research, please [cite us](http://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2021/varun_kapoor.html).


## Examples

VollSeg comes with different options to combine CARE based denoising with UNET, StarDist and segmentation in a region of interest (ROI). We present some examples which are represent optimal combination of these different modes for segmenting different cell types. We summarize this in the table below:
| Example Image | Description | Training Data | Trained Model |
| --- | --- |--- | --- |
| ![Raw Ascadian Embryo](images/Ascadian_raw.png)| Light sheet fused from four angles 3D single channel| [Training Data ~320 GB](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Astec-half-Pm1_Cut_at_2-cell_stage_half_Phallusia_mammillata_embryo_live_SPIM_imaging_stages_6-16_/11309570?backTo=/s/765d4361d1b073beedd5)| [UNET model](https://zenodo.org/record/6337699) |

Run simulations of the [wave equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_equation) in nD on grids of variable speed in Python. This library owes a lot of its design and approach to the [fdtd](https://github.com/flaport/fdtd) library, a Python 3D electromagnetic FDTD simulator.

This package allows for a fair amount of customization over your wave simulation. You can
 - specify the size and spacing of the grid
 - specify the time step for the simulation, which will be checked to ensure stability of the simulation
 - specify the duration of the simulation
 - setting a variable speed array (one value per grid point) to allow for ""objects"" in your environment
 - set the source of the wave, which can be a point, line, or any (n-1)D subarray
 - record the wave with a detector, which can be the full grid, the full boundary, or a particular boundary
 - use convenience methods to run many simulations with different sources on the same grid and detector combination

You can use [napari](https://napari.org/), a multi-dimensional image viewer for Python, to allow for easy visualization of the detected wave. Some functionality is also available as a napari plugin to allow for running simulations from a graphical user interface.

Results can look like

----------------------------------

## Installation

You can install `waver` via [pip]:

    pip install waver

## Usage

### Convenience Methods

The most convenient way to use waver is to use one of two convenience methods that will create and run a simulation
for you and return the results.

The first method `run_single_source` allows you to run a single simulation with a single source on one grid and 
record the results using a detector. For example

```python
from waver.simulation import run_single_source

single_sim_params = {
    'size': (12.8e-3, 12.8e-3),
    'spacing': 100e-6,
    'duration': 80e-6,
    'min_speed': 343,
    'max_speed': 686,
    'speed': 686,
    'time_step': 50e-9,
    'temporal_downsample': 2,
    'location': (6.4e-3, 6.4e-3),
    'period': 5e-6,
    'ncycles':1,
}

detected_wave, speed_grid = run_single_source(**single_sim_params)
```

The second method `run_multiple_sources` allows you to run multiple simulations with multiple sources on the same
grid and with the same detector and return the results. For example

```python
from waver.simulation import run_multiple_sources

multi_sim_params = {
    'size': (12.8e-3, 12.8e-3),
    'spacing': 100e-6,
    'duration': 80e-6,
    'min_speed': 343,
    'max_speed': 686,
    'speed': 686,
    'time_step': 50e-9,
    'temporal_downsample': 2,
    'sources': [{
        'location': (6.4e-3, 6.4e-3),
        'period': 5e-6,
        'ncycles':1,
    }]
}

detected_wave, speed_grid = run_multiple_sources(**multi_sim_params)
```

The main difference between these two methods is that `run_multiple_sources` takes a `sources` parameter which takes a list 
of dictionaries with keys corresponding to source related keyword arguments found in `run_single_source`.

### Visualization

If you want to quickly visualize the results of `run_multiple_sources`, you can use the `run_and_visualize` command which will 
run the simulation and then launch napari with the results, as seen in [examples/2D/point_source.py](./examples/2D/point_source.py)

```python
from waver.datasets import run_and_visualize

run_and_visualize(**multi_sim_params)
```

### Datasets

If you want to run simulations with on many different speed grids you can use the `generate_simulation_dataset` method as a convenience. The results will be saved to a [zarr](https://zarr.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) file of your chosing. You can then use the `load_simulation_dataset` to load the dataset.

```python
from waver.datasets import generate_simulation_dataset

# Define root path for simulation
path = './simulation_dataset.zarr'
runs = 5

# Define a simulation, 12.8mm, 100um spacing
dataset_sim_params = {
    'size': (12.8e-3, 12.8e-3),
    'spacing': 100e-6,
    'duration': 80e-6,
    'min_speed': 343,
    'max_speed': 686,
    'speed': 'mixed_random_ifft',
    'time_step': 50e-9,
    'sources': [{
        'location': (None, 0),
        'period': 5e-6,
        'ncycles':1,
    }],
    'temporal_downsample': 2,
    'boundary': 1,
    'edge': 1,
}

# Run and save simulation
generate_simulation_dataset(path, runs, **dataset_sim_params)
```

The `generate_simulation_dataset` allows the `speed` to be a string that will specify a particular method of randomly generating speed values for the simulation grid.

### The Simulation Object

If you'd like to understand in a little bit more detail how a simulation is defined then you might want to use the unerlying simulation object `Simulation` and manually set key objects like the `Source` and `Detector`. A full example of this is as follows

```python
# Create a simulation
sim = Simulation(size=size, spacing=spacing, max_speed=max_speed, time_step=time_step)

# Set speed array
sim.set_speed(speed=speed, min_speed=min_speed, max_speed=max_speed)

# Add source
sim.add_source(location=location, period=period, ncycles=ncycles, phase=phase)

# Add detector grid
sim.add_detector(spatial_downsample=spatial_downsample,
                    boundary=boundary, edge=edge)

# Run simulation
sim.run(duration=duration, temporal_downsample=temporal_downsample, progress=progress, leave=leave)

# Print simulation wave and speed data
print('wave: ', sim.detected_wave)
print('speed: ', sim.grid_speed)
```

Note these steps are done inside the `run_single_source` method for you as a convenience.

## Known Limitations

A [perfectly matched layer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perfectly_matched_layer) boundary has recently been added, but might not perform well under all conditions. Additional contributions would be welcome here.

Right now the simulations are quite slow. I'd like to add a [JAX](https://github.com/google/jax) backend, but 
havn't done so yet. Contributions would be welcome.

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome. Tests can be run with [tox], please ensure
the coverage at least stays the same before you submit a pull request.

A [napari] plugin for loading data from [yt].

This readme provides a brief overview including:

1. [Installation](#Installation)
2. [Quick Start](#Quick-Start)
3. [Contributing](#Contributing)

Full documentation is available at [yt-napari.readthedocs.io].

## Installation

### 1. (optional) install `yt` and `napari`

If you skip this step, the installation in the following section will only install the minimal package requirements for `yt` or `napari`, in which case you will likely need to manually install some packages. So if you are new to either package, or if you are installing in a clean environment, it may be simpler to  install these packages first.

For `napari`,

    pip install napari[all]

will install `napari` with the default `Qt` backend (see [here](https://napari.org/tutorials/fundamentals/installation#choosing-a-different-qt-backend) for how to choose between `PyQt5` or `PySide2`).

For `yt`, you will need `yt>=4.0.1` and any of the optional dependencies for your particular workflow. If you know that you'll need more than the base `yt` install, you can install the full suite of dependent packages with

    pip install yt[full]

See the [`yt` documentation](https://yt-project.org/doc/installing.html#leveraging-optional-yt-runtime-dependencies) for more information. If you're not sure which packages you'll need but don't want the full yt installation, you can proceed to the next step and then install any packages as needed (you will receive error messages when a required package is missing).

### 2. install `yt-napari`

You can install the `yt-napari` plugin with:

    pip install yt-napari

If you are missing either `yt` or `napari` (or they need to be updated), the above installation will fetch and run a minimal installation for both.

To install the latest development version of the plugin instead, use:

    pip install git+https://github.com/data-exp-lab/yt-napari.git

Note that if you are working off the development version, be sure to use the latest documentation
for reference: https://yt-napari.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

## Quick Start

After [installation](#Installation), there are three modes of using `yt-napari`:

1. jupyter notebook interaction ([jump down](#jupyter-notebook-interaction))
2. loading a json file from the napari gui ([jump down](#loading-a-json-file-from-the-napari-gui))
3. napari widget plugins ([jump down](#napari-widget-plugins))

### jupyter notebook interaction

`yt-napari` provides a helper class, `yt_napari.viewer.Scene` that assists in properly aligning new yt selections in the napari viewer when working in a Jupyter notebook.

```python
import napari
import yt
from yt_napari.viewer import Scene
from napari.utils import nbscreenshot

viewer = napari.Viewer()
ds = yt.load(""IsolatedGalaxy/galaxy0030/galaxy0030"")
yt_scene = Scene()

left_edge = ds.domain_center - ds.arr([40, 40, 40], 'kpc')
right_edge = ds.domain_center + ds.arr([40, 40, 40], 'kpc')
res = (600, 600, 600)

yt_scene.add_region(viewer,
                    ds,
                    (""enzo"", ""Temperature""),
                    left_edge=left_edge,
                    right_edge=right_edge,
                    resolution=res)

yt_scene.add_region(viewer,
                    ds,
                    (""enzo"", ""Density""),
                    left_edge=left_edge,
                    right_edge=right_edge,
                    resolution=res)

nbscreenshot(viewer)
```

 ![Loading a subset of a yt dataset in napari from a Jupyter notebook](./assets/images/readme_ex_001.png)

`yt_scene.add_to_viewer` accepts any of the keyword arguments allowed by `viewer.add_image`. See the full documentation ([yt-napari.readthedocs.io]) for more examples, including additional helper methods for linking layer appearance.

Additionally, with `yt_napari`>= v0.2.0, you can use the `yt_napari.timeseries` module to help sample and load in selections from across datasets.

### loading a selection from a yt dataset interactively

`yt-napari` provides two ways to sample a yt dataset and load in an image layer into a Napari viewer: the yt Reader plugin and json file specification.

#### using the yt Reader plugin

To use the yt Reader plugin, click on `Plugins -> yt-napari: yt Reader`. From there, add a region or slice selector then specify a field type and field and bounds to sample  between and then simply click ""Load"":

![Loading a subset of a yt dataset from the napari viewer](./assets/images/readme_ex_003_gui_reader.gif)

You can add multiple selections and load them all at once or adjust values and click ""Load"" again.

#### using the yt Time Series Reader plugin

To use the yt Time Series Reader plugin, click on  `Plugins -> yt-napari: yt Time Series Reader`. Specify your file matching: use `file_pattern` to enter glob expressions or use `file_list` to enter a list of specific files.
Then add a slice or region to sample for each matched dataset file (note: be careful of memory here!):

![Loading timeseries selections from the napari viewer](./assets/images/readme_ex_004_gui_timeseries.gif)

#### using a json file and schema

`yt-napari` also provides the ability to load json that contain specifications for loading a file. Properly formatted files can be loaded from the napari GUI as you would load any image file (`File->Open`). The json file describes the selection process for a dataset as described by a json-schema. The following json file results in similar layers as the above examples:


```json
{""$schema"": ""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/data-exp-lab/yt-napari/main/src/yt_napari/schemas/yt-napari_0.0.1.json"",
 ""datasets"": [{""filename"": ""IsolatedGalaxy/galaxy0030/galaxy0030"",
               ""selections"": {""regions"": [{
                                ""fields"": [{""field_name"": ""Temperature"", ""field_type"": ""enzo"", ""take_log"": true},
                                           {""field_name"": ""Density"", ""field_type"": ""enzo"", ""take_log"": true}],
                                ""left_edge"": [460.0, 460.0, 460.0],
                                ""right_edge"": [560.0, 560.0, 560.0],
                                ""resolution"": [600, 600, 600]
                              }]},
               ""edge_units"": ""kpc""
             }]
}
```

To help in filling out a json file, it is recommended that you use an editor capable of parsing a json schema and displaying hints. For example, in vscode, you will see field suggestions after specifying the `yt-napari` schema:

![interactive json completion for yt-napari](./assets/images/readme_ex_002_json.png)

See the full documentation at [yt-napari.readthedocs.io] for a complete specification.


## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome! Development follows a fork and pull request workflow. To get started, you'll need a development installation and a testing environment.

### development environment

To start developing, fork the repository and clone your fork to get a local copy. You can then install in development mode with

    pip install -e .

### tests and style checks

Both bug fixes and new features will need to pass the existing test suite and style checks. While both will be run automatically when you submit a pull request, it is helpful to run the test suites locally and run style checks throughout development. For testing, you can use [tox] to test different python versions on your platform.

    pip install tox

And then from the top level of the `yt-napari` directory, run

    tox

Tox will then run a series of tests in isolated environments. In addition to checking the terminal output for test results, the tox run will generate a test coverage report: a `coverage.xml` file and a `htmlcov` folder -- to view the results, open `htmlcov/index.html` in a browser.

If you prefer a lighter weight test, you can also use `pytest` directly and rely on the Github CI to test different python versions and systems. To do so, first install `pytest` and some related plugins:

    pip install pytest pytest-qt pytest-cov

Now, to run the tests:

    pytest -v --cov=yt_napari --cov-report=html

In addition to telling you whether or not the tests pass, the above command will write out a code coverage report to the `htmlcov` directory. You can open up `htmlcov/index.html` in a browser and check out the lines of code that were missed by existing tests.

For style checks, you can use [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) to run checks as you develop. To set up `pre-commit`:

    pip install pre-commit
    pre-commit install

after which, every time you run `git commit`, some automatic style adjustments and checks will run. The same style checks will run when you submit a pull request, but it's often easier to catch them early.

After submitting a pull request, the `pre-commit.ci` bot will run the style checks. If style checks fail, you can have the bot attempt to auto-fix the failures by adding the following in a comment on it's own:

    pre-commit.ci autofix

The bot will then commit changes to your pull request after which you will want to run `git pull` locally to update your local version of the branch before making further changes to the branch.

### building documentation locally

Documentation can be built using `sphinx` in two steps. First, update the api mapping with

    sphinx-apidoc -f -o docs/source src/yt_napari/

This will update the `rst` files in `docs/source/` with the latest docstrings in `yt_napari`. Next, build the html documentation with

    make html


### updating the pydantic models and schema

The schema versioning follows a `major.minor.micro` versioning pattern that matches the yt-napari versioning. Each yt-napari release should have an accompanying updated schema file, even if the  contents of the schema file have not changed. On-disk schema are stored in  `src/yt_napari/schemas/`, with copies in the documentation at `docs/_static`.

There are a number of utilities to help automate the management of schema in `repo_utilities/`. The easiest way to use these utitities is with `taskipy` from the command line. To list available scripts:

```commandline
task --list
```

Before a release, run

```commandline
task validate_release vX.X.X
```

where `vX.X.X` is the version of the upcoming release. This script will run through some checks that ensure:
* the on-disk schema matches the schema generated by the pydantic model
* the schema files in the documentation match the schema files in the package

If any of the checks fail, you will be advised to update the schema using `update_schema_docs`. If you
run without providing a version:

```commandline
task update_schema_docs
```

It will simply copy over the existing on-disk schema files to the documentation. If you run with a version:

```commandline
task update_schema_docs -v vX.X.X
```
It will write a schema file for the current pydantic model, overwriting any on-disk schema files for
the provided version.

## Installation

You can install `workshop-demo` via [pip]:

    pip install workshop-demo


To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/DragaDoncila/workshop-demo.git

## What is this?

This plugin was created to serve as a semi-meaningful example of a plugin using
the new napari [npe2](https://pypi.org/project/npe2/) architecture.

It provides a reader, a writer and two dock widgets to support opening, processing
and writing out [cell tracking challenge](https://celltrackingchallenge.net/) data.

We've provided comments and example tests that can be used as a reference
when building your own plugin.

## Using this plugin

### Sample Data
You can download sample data for this plugin from the tracking challenge website. Any 2D+T
sequence should work, but this plugin has been tested only with the 
[Human hepatocarcinoma-derived cells expressing the fusion protein YFP-TIA-1](http://data.celltrackingchallenge.net/training-datasets/Fluo-C2DL-Huh7.zip) 
dataset.
### Reading Data
This plugin's reader is designed for tracking challenge segmentation gold standard ground truth
data conforming to the file format described in the [data specification](https://public.celltrackingchallenge.net/documents/Naming%20and%20file%20content%20conventions.pdf).

Ground truth data is only provided for a subset of the frames of the entire sequence. This
reader will attempt to find the number of frames of the associated sequence in a sister
directory of the ground truth data directory and open a labels layer with the same number
of frames, thus ensuring the labelled data is correctly overlaid onto the original sequence.

### Segmenting Data
One of the dock widgets provided by this plugin is ""Segment by Threshold"". The widget
allows you to select a 2D+T image layer in the viewer (e.g. any of the sequences in the Human 
hepatocarcinoma dataset above) and segment it using a selection of scikit-image thresholding functions.

The segmentation is then returned as a `Labels` layer into the viewer.

### Highlighting Segmentation Differences
The second dock widget provided by this plugin allows you to visually compare your segmentation
against the ground truth data by computing the difference between the two and adding this as a
layer in the napari viewer.

To use this widget, open it from the Plugins menu and select the two layers you wish to compare.

### Writing to Zip
Finally, you can save your segmentation to a zip file whose internal directory structure
will closely mimic that of the tracking challenge datasets, so that it may be opened 
again in the viewer.

To save your layer, choose File -> Save selected layer(s) with *one* labels layer selected,
then select label zipper from the dropdown choices.
