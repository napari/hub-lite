A plugin to perform deep learning on small to medium sized image sets with UNETs, Cellpose, Stardist, SAM and friends.  In particular this plugin is useful for performing deep learning with a small number of labels and augmentation, and experimenting with different deep learning frameworks.  

Important note on dependencies:  This plugin is designed to work with different permutations of dependencies.  For example it should work if one of Pytorch, Cellpose, SAM and/or Stardist is installed but does not require all.   Thus we don't specify all the dependencies and leave it up to the user to install the permutation of DL related dependencies they would like to use.  More detailed instructions are below. 

If you have any questions about dependencies splease post on the [Image.sc](Image.sc) forum. 

----------------------------------

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

## Installation

To install latest development version :

    pip install git+https://github.com/bnorthan/napari-easy-augment-batch-dl.git

You will also need to install the latest development version of tnia-python:

    pip install git+https://github.com/True-North-Intelligent-Algorithms/tnia-python.git

You will need to install napari and for augmentation you will need albumentations library.  Also explicitly install numpy 1.26.  (We have not tested with numpy 2.0 so it is a good idea to explicitly install numpy 1.26 to avoid another dependency installing numpy 2.x)

```
    pip install numpy==1.26
    pip install napari[all]
    pip install albumentations
    pip install matplotlib
```

You will also need one or more of stardist, cellpose, segment-everything or Yolo

### Stardist

#### Windows

```
    conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.2 cudnn=8.1.0
    pip install "tensorflow<2.11"
    pip install stardist==0.8.5
    pip install gputools
    pip install edt
```

#### Linux

```
    pip install tensorflow[and-cuda]
    pip install stardist
    pip install gputools
    pip install edt
```

### Pytorch (for unet segmentation)

```
    pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118
    pip install pytorch-lightning
    pip install monai
    pip install scipy
    pip install tifffile
```

### Cellpose

```
    pip install cellpose
```

### SAM (Segment Anything)

```
    pip install segment-everything
```

###

You can install `napari-easy-augment-batch-dl` via [pip]:
