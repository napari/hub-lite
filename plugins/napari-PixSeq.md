A **Napari** plugin for extracting time series traces from single molecule FRET data.

napari-PixSeq uses **Picasso** (picassosr) as a backend and includes features for **aligning** image channels/datasets, **undrifting** images, **detecting/fitting** localisations and extracting **traces**, and supports both **ALEX** and **FRET** data. Traces can be exported in different formats for downstream analysis.

napari-PixSeq traces can be analysed with TraceAnalyser: https://github.com/piedrro/TraceAnalyser

This is still undergoing development, so some features may not work as expected.

This was built by Dr Piers Turner from the Kapanidis Lab, University of Oxford.
