This plugin is built upon the python package [BrightEyes-ISM]. Napari-ISM enables the simulation, loading, and analysis of ISM datasets.
More in detail, it performs:

* Loading and compression of .h5 files generated by the [MCS software].
* Simulation of a realistic dataset of tubulin filaments.
* Simulation of realistic ISM Point Spread Functions.
* Summing over the detector array dimension
* Adaptive Pixel Reassignment
* Multi-image deconvolution
* Focus-ISM

## Installation

You can install `napari-ISM` via [PyPI]:

    pip install napari-ISM
    
or by using [napari hub].

It requires the following Python packages

    numpy
    scipy
    h5py
    PyQt5
    brighteyes-ism>=1.2.0

## Documentation

To generate a simulated dataset, go to `File > Open Sample > ISM dataset`. 

![](https://github.com/VicidominiLab/napari-ISM/raw/main/docs/sample.png)

To acces the plugin list, go to `Plugins > Napari-ISM`.

![](https://github.com/VicidominiLab/napari-ISM/raw/main/docs/plugin_list.png)

To open a .h5 file, go to `File > Open `.
You can then sum over the dimensions that are not needed, using the command `integrateDims`.
The default axes are 0 (repetition), 1 (axial position), and 4 (time).

![](https://github.com/VicidominiLab/napari-ISM/raw/main/docs/file.png)

Note that all the analysis commands expect an input with size `X x Y X Ch`.

To see the result of summing over the SPAD dimensions `Ch`, use the plugin command `Sum`. Then, press `Run`.

To see the result of Adaptive Pixel Reassignment, use the plugin command `APR_stack`.
Select as reference image (`ref`) the central one. Select an upsampling factor (`usf`), 
which corresponds to the sub-pixel precision of the shift-vector estimation. Then, press `Run`.

![](https://github.com/VicidominiLab/napari-ISM/raw/main/docs/apr.png)

To generate the PSFs, use the plugin command `PSFs`. Select an image layer (`img layer`), 
it will be used to determine the number of pixels and the pixel size.
Then, select the detector pixel size (`pxsize`) and pixel pitch (`pxpitch`) in microns.
Select the magnification of the system (`M`). Select the excitation (`exWl`) and emission wavelength (`emWl`) in nanometers.
Then, press `Run`.

![](https://github.com/VicidominiLab/napari-ISM/raw/main/docs/PSF.png)

To see the result of multi-image deconvolution, use the plugin command `Deconvolution`.
Select an image layer (`img layer`) containing the ISM dataset to deconvolve and another image layer (`psf layer`) containing the PSFs, either simulated or experimental.
Then, press `Run`.

![](https://github.com/VicidominiLab/napari-ISM/raw/main/docs/deconv.png)

To use Focus-ISM, first select a region on the input dataset using a `shapes` layer.
Select a rectangle containing mainly in-focus emitters. It will be used as a calibration.
Then, use the plugin command `Focus-ISM`. Select an image layer (`img layer`) containing the ISM dataset and a shape layer (`shape layer`) defining the calibration region.
Select a lower bound for the standard deviation of the out-of-focus curve (`sigma B bound`) in units of standard deviations of the in-focus term. We suggest to never select a value below 2.
Select a threshold (`threshold`) in units of photon counts. Scan coordinates with less photons than the threshold will be skipped in the analysis and classified as background. Then, press `Run`.

![](https://github.com/VicidominiLab/napari-ISM/raw/main/docs/shapes.png)

To use FRC, prepare the dataset to be in the shape `xyt`.
Select the theshodling method (`method`) and smoothing method (`smoothing`) among those available.
Then, press `Calculate`.
