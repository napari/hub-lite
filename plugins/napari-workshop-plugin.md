The purpose of this repository is to provide a template for a napari plugin that can be used as a starting point for the napari software development workshop 2023.
It should help you to see the basics of building documentation, testing, and continuous integration for a napari plugin.

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [@napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.
The cookiecutter plugin is also a great jumping off point for your own plugin development.
