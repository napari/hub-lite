A collection of widgets intended to serve any person seeking to process microscopy images from start to finish, *with no coding necessary*. `napari-ndev` was designed to address the **gap between the napari viewer and batch python scripting**.

* Accepts **diverse image formats**, dimensionality, file size, and maintains key metadata.
* Allows **advanced, arbitrary image processing** workflows to be used by novices.
* **User-friendly** sparse annotation and batch training of **machine learning classifiers**.
* Flexible label measurements, parsing of metadata, and summarization for **easily readable datasets**.
* Designed for ease of use, modification, and reproducibility.

## Installation

**napari-ndev** is a pure Python package, and can be installed with [pip]:

```bash
pip install napari-ndev
```

If napari is currently not installed in your environment, you will also need to include a QtPy backend:

```bash
pip install napari-ndev[qtpy-backend]
```

The easiest way to get started with **napari-ndev** is to install all the optional dependencies (see note below) with:

```bash
pip install napari-ndev[all]
```

----------------------------------

### Optional Libraries

**napari-ndev** is most useful when interacting with some other napari plugins (e.g. napari-assistant) and can read additional filetypes. A few extra BSD3 compatible napari-plugins may be installed with [pip]:

```bash
pip install napari-ndev[extras]
```

**napari-ndev** can optionally use GPL-3 licensed libraries to enhance its functionality, but are not required. If you choose to install and use these optional dependencies, you must comply with the GPL-3 license terms. The main functional improvement is from some `bioio` libraries to support extra image formats, including `czi` and `lif` files. These libraries can be installed with [pip]:

```bash
pip install napari-ndev[gpl-extras]
```

In addition, you may need to install specific [`bioio` readers](https://github.com/bioio-devs/bioio) to support your specific image, such as `bioio-czi` and `bioio-lif` (included in `[gpl-extras]`) or `bioio-bioformats`.

### Development Libraries

For development use the `[dev]` optional libraries to verify your changes, which includes the `[docs]` and `[testing]` optional groups. However, the Github-CI will test pull requests with `[testing]` only.

----------------------------------

The wide breadth of this plugin's scope is only made possible by the amazing libraries and plugins from the python and napari community, especially [Robert Haase](https://github.com/haesleinhuepf).

This [napari] plugin was generated with [Cookiecutter] using [napari]'s [cookiecutter-napari-plugin] template.

## Contributing

Contributions are very welcome. Tests can be run with [tox], please ensure

"napari-ndev" is free and open source software.
