A napari plugin for the DeepFinder library which includes display, annotation, target generation, segmentation and clustering functionalities.
An orthoslice view has been added for an easier visualisation and annotation process.

> [!WARNING]
>
> An upstream bug in `napari` versions **â‰¥ 0.5.0** causes the menu bar to break when closing the *Orthoslice view*.
> 
> See this issue for more details: https://github.com/napari/napari/issues/7588.
> 
> As a temporary workaround, you can use [napari v0.4.19](https://github.com/napari/napari/releases/tag/v0.4.19), which is not affected by this bug.
