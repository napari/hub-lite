The `napari-tmidas` plugin consists of a growing collection of pipelines for fast batch processing of confocal and whole slide microscopy images of biological tissues. This is a WIP and based on the CLI version of [T-MIDAS](https://github.com/MercaderLabAnatomy/T-MIDAS).

## Features
Currently, napari-tmidas provides pipelines as widgets for batch image conversion / cropping / processing, ROI colocalization and label inspection (cf. [Usage](#usage) below).

## Installation

First, install Napari in a virtual environment:

    mamba create -y -n napari-tmidas -c conda-forge python=3.11 tqdm
    mamba activate napari-tmidas
    python -m pip install "napari[all]"

Now you can install `napari-tmidas` via [pip]:

    pip install napari-tmidas

It is recommended to install the latest development version:

    pip install git+https://github.com/macromeer/napari-tmidas.git

### Dependencies

To use the Batch Microscopy Image Conversion pipeline, we need some libraries to read microscopy formats:

    pip install nd2 readlif tiffslide pylibCZIrw acquifer-napari

For the Batch Crop Anything pipeline, we need to install MobileSAM and its dependencies:

    pip install git+https://github.com/ChaoningZhang/MobileSAM.git


If you want to batch compress images using [Zstandard](https://github.com/facebook/zstd), use the package manager of your operating system to install it:

    sudo apt-get install zstd    # for Linux
    brew install zstd            # for macOS
    choco install zstandard      # for Windows


## Usage

To use the plugin, start napari in the activated virtual environment with this terminal command:

    mamba run -n napari-tmidas napari

You can then find the installed plugin in the Plugins tab.

### Microscopy Image Conversion

You can start this pipeline via `Plugins > T-MIDAS > Batch Microscopy Image Conversion`. Currently, this pipeline supports the conversion of `.nd2, .lif, .ndpi, .czi` and acquifer data. After scanning a folder of your choice for microscopy image data, select a file in the first column of the table and preview and export any image data it contains.

### Image Processing

1. After opening `Plugins > T-MIDAS > Batch Image Processing`, enter the path to the folder containing the images to be processed (currently supports TIF, later also ZARR). You can also filter for filename suffix.

2. As a result, a table appears with the found images. You can click on them to inspect them in the viewer.

3. Next, select a processing function, set parameters if applicable and `Start Batch Processing`.

4. You can click on the images in the table to show them in the viewer. For example first click on one of the `Original Files`, and then the corresponding `Processed File` to see an overlay.

Note that whenever you click on an `Original File` or `Processed File` in the table, it will replace the one that is currently shown in the viewer. So naturally, you'd first select the original image, and then the processed image to correctly see the image pair that you want to inspect.

### Batch Label Inspection
If you have already segmented a folder full of images and now you want to maybe inspect and edit each label image, you can use the `Plugins > T-MIDAS > Batch Label Inspection`, which automatically saves your changes to the existing label image once you click the `Save Changes and Continue` button (bottom right).

### Crop Anything
This pipeline combines the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for automatic object detection with an interactive interface for selecting and cropping multiple objects from images. To launch the widget, open `Plugins > T-MIDAS > Batch Crop Anything`. Click the image below to see a video demo.

### ROI Colocalization
This pipeline quantifies colocalization between labeled regions of interest (ROIs) across multiple image channels. It determines the extent of overlap between ROIs in a reference channel and those in one or two other channels. The output is a table of colocalization counts. Optionally, the size of reference channel ROIs, as well as the total or median size of colocalizing ROIs in the other channels, can be included. Colocalization is determined using Boolean masking. The number of colocalizing instances is determined by counting unique label IDs within the overlapping regions. Typically, the reference channel contains larger structures, while other channels contain smaller, potentially nested, structures. For example, the reference channel might contain cell bodies, with the second and third channels containing nuclei and sub-nuclear objects, respectively.
