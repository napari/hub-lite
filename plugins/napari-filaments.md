A napari plugin for filament analysis.

This plugin helps you to manually track filaments using path shapes of `Shapes` layer.

![](https://github.com/hanjinliu/napari-filaments/raw/main/resources/fit.gif)

Currently implemented functions

- Fit paths to filaments in an image as a 2-D spline curve.
- Clip/extend paths.
- Measurement of filament length at sub-pixel precision.
- Basic quantification (mean, std, etc.) along paths.
- Import paths from ImageJ ROI file.

Basic Usage
-----------

Click `Layers > open image` to open a tif file. You'll find the image you chose and a shapes layer are added to the layer list.

![](https://github.com/hanjinliu/napari-filaments/raw/main/resources/fig-1.png)

- The "target filaments" box shows the working shapes layer.
- The "target image" box shows the image layer on which fitting and quantification will be conducted.
- The "filament" box shows currently selected shape (initially this box is empty).

Add path shapes and push key `F1` to fit the shape to the filament in the target image layer.

- In the "Spline" tab, you can cut/extend or re-fit splines.
- In the "Measure" tab, click "measure property" to measure mean instensity etc along each spline.

How it works
------------

Spline fitting is done as following.
