This implementation of the napari hub is developed and managed by the napari team. It is based on an original implementation by Yunha Lee.

The website is deployed daily using GitHub pages and contains plugin information served by [npe2api](https://github.com/napari/npe2api). This GitHub repository contains the Python scripts, javascript, HTML
templates and CSS templates required to build the web pages.

The `fetch_napari_data.py` script queries [npe2api](https://github.com/napari/npe2api) for plugin information including PyPI/conda info and individual plugin manifests.

The `create_static_html_files.py` script uses this data to generate HTML files for each individual plugin page as well as for the plugin listing on the website's homepage.

The `plugin_loading_and_search.js` script contains functions for loading the main plugin list and searching.

The `build_and_deploy.yml` workflow builds the website using the above scripts and deploys it to GitHub pages.

## Local Development

```sh
# this deletes the `_build` directory and everything inside it
make clean

# this runs the required Python scripts and populates the `_build` directory
make all
```

```sh
make serve-local
```
